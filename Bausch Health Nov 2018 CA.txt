Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

$10,000,000 and whole increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in any case, such lesser amount of such Term Loans then outstanding or which is otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Auction Agent and the Administrative Agent
(if different from the Auction Agent)) (the “Auction Amount”), (ii) specify the discount to par (which may be a range (the “Discount Range”) of percentages of the par principal amount of the Term Loans subject to such Auction), that

on an individual Class basis and (iv) remain outstanding through the Auction Response Date. The Auction Agent will promptly provide each appropriate Lender with a copy of the Auction Notice and a form of the Return Bid to be

increments of $1,000,000 (or, in any case, such lesser amount of such Term Loans of such Lender then outstanding or which is otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Auction Agent) (the “Reply Amount”). Lenders may only submit one
Return Bid per Auction, but each Return Bid may contain up to three bids only one of which may result in a Qualifying Bid. In addition to the Return Bid, the participating Lender must execute and deliver, to be held in escrow by the
Auction Agent, an Assignment and Assumption with the dollar amount of the Term Loans to be assigned to be left in blank, which amount shall be completed by the Auction Agent in accordance with the final determination of such

(c) Acceptance Procedures. Based on the Reply Prices and Reply Amounts received by the Auction Agent prior to the applicable Auction Response Date, the Auction Agent, in consultation with the Auction Party, will
determine the applicable price (the “Applicable Price”) for the Auction, which will be the lowest Reply Price for which the Auction Party can complete the Auction at the Auction Amount; provided that, in the event that the Reply
Amounts are
27
insufficient to allow the Auction Party to complete a purchase of the entire Auction Amount (any such Auction, a “Failed Auction”), the Auction Party shall either, at its election, (i) withdraw the Auction or (ii) complete the Auction at an
Applicable Price equal to the highest Reply Price. The Auction Party shall purchase the relevant Term Loans (or the respective portions thereof) from each Lender with a Reply Price that is equal to or lower than the Applicable Price
(“Qualifying Bids”) at the Applicable Price; provided that if the aggregate proceeds required to purchase all Term Loans subject to Qualifying Bids would exceed the Auction Amount for such Auction, the Auction Party shall purchase such
Term Loans at the Applicable Price ratably based on the principal amounts of such Qualifying Bids (subject to rounding requirements specified by the Auction Agent in its discretion). If a Lender has submitted a Return Bid containing
multiple bids at different Reply Prices, only the bid with the lowest Reply Price that is equal to or less than the Applicable Price will be deemed to be the Qualifying Bid of such Lender (e.g., a Reply Price of $100 with a discount to par of
1%, when compared to an Applicable Price of $100 with a 2% discount to par, will not be deemed to be a Qualifying Bid, while, however, a Reply Price of $100 with a discount to par of 2.50% would be deemed to be a Qualifying Bid). The
Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within five Business Days following the Auction Response Date with respect to an Auction, notify (I) the Parent of the respective Lenders’ responses to such solicitation, the effective date of
the purchase of Term Loans pursuant to such Auction, the Applicable Price, and the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans and the tranches thereof to be purchased pursuant to such Auction, (II) each participating Lender of the
effective date of the purchase of Term Loans pursuant to such Auction, the Applicable Price, and the aggregate principal amount and the tranches of Term Loans to be purchased at the Applicable Price on such date, (III) each participating
Lender of the aggregate principal amount and the tranches of the Term Loans of such Lender to be purchased at the Applicable Price on such date and (IV) if applicable, each participating Lender of any rounding and/or proration pursuant to
the second preceding sentence. Each determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Parent and Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.
(d) Additional Procedures.
(i) Once initiated by an Auction Notice, the Auction Party may not withdraw an Auction other than a Failed Auction. Furthermore, in connection with any Auction, upon submission by a Lender of a
Qualifying Bid, such Lender (each, a “Qualifying Lender”) will be obligated to sell the entirety or its allocable portion of the Reply Amount, as the case may be, at the Applicable Price.
(ii) To the extent not expressly provided for herein, each purchase of Term Loans pursuant to an Auction shall be consummated pursuant to procedures consistent with the provisions in this definition,
established by the Auction Agent acting in its reasonable discretion and as reasonably agreed by the Parent.
(iii) In connection with any Auction, the Parent and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that the Auction Agent may require as a condition to any Auction, the payment of customary fees and expenses by

Section 1.04.

Accounting Terms; GAAP.

(a)
(i)
All financial statements to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or
financial nature that are used in calculating the Total Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Secured Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated Total Assets shall be
construed and interpreted in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time; provided that (A) if any change to GAAP or in the application thereof (including the conversion to IFRS as described below) is implemented after the date of delivery of the
financial statements described in Section 3.04(a) and/or there is any change in the functional currency reflected in the financial statements or (B) if the Parent elects or is required to report under IFRS, the Parent or the Required Lenders may request to amend
the relevant affected provisions hereof (whether or not the request for such amendment is delivered before or after the relevant change or election) to eliminate the effect of such change or election, as the case may be, on the operation of such provisions and
(x) the Parent and the Administrative Agent shall negotiate in good faith to enter into an amendment of the relevant affected provisions (it being understood that no amendment or similar fee shall be payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
connection therewith) to preserve the original intent thereof in light of the applicable change or election, as the case may be and (y) the relevant affected provisions shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP and the currency, in each case, as in effect and
applied immediately prior to the applicable change or election, as the case may be, until the request for amendment has been withdrawn by the Parent or the Required Lenders, as applicable, or this Agreement has been amended as contemplated hereby. Any
consent required from the Administrative Agent or any Required Lender with respect to the foregoing shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
(ii)
All terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made, without giving effect to (i) any election under Accounting
Standards Codification 825-10-25 (previously referred to as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 159) (or any other Accounting Standards Codification, International Accounting Standard or Financial Accounting Standard
68
having a similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Parent or any subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein, (ii) any treatment of Indebtedness in respect of convertible debt instruments under Accounting Standards
Codification 470-20 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification, International Accounting Standard or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any such Indebtedness in a reduced or bifurcated manner as described
therein, and such Indebtedness shall at all times be valued at the full stated principal amount thereof and (iii) the application of Accounting Standards Codification 480, 815, 805 and 718 (to the extent these pronouncements under Accounting Standards
Codification 718 result in recording an equity award as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the circumstance where, but for the application of the pronouncements, such award would have been classified
as equity). If the Parent notifies the Administrative Agent that the Parent is required to report under IFRS or has elected to do so through an early adoption policy, “GAAP” shall mean international financial reporting standards pursuant to IFRS (provided
thereafter, the Parent cannot elect to report under GAAP).
(b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to Sections 1.04(d), (e) and (g), all financial ratios and tests (including the Total Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Secured Leverage Ratio, the Interest
Coverage Ratio and the amount of Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Net Income and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA) contained in this Agreement that are calculated with respect to any Test Period during which any Subject Transaction occurs shall
be calculated with respect to such Test Period and such Subject Transaction on a Pro Forma Basis. Further, if since the beginning of any such Test Period and on or prior to the date of any required calculation of any financial ratio or test (x) any Subject
Transaction has occurred or (y) any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into any Borrower or any of the Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test Period has
consummated any Subject Transaction, then, in each case, any applicable financial ratio or test shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis for such Test Period as if such Subject Transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period (or, in the
case of Consolidated Total Assets (or with respect to any determination pertaining to the balance sheet, including the acquisition of Cash and Cash Equivalents), as of the last day of such Test Period), it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that solely
for purposes of (x) calculating quarterly compliance with Section 6.15 and (y) calculating the First Lien Leverage Ratio for purposes of the definitions of “Applicable Rate” and “Commitment Fee Rate”, in each case, the date of the required calculation shall
be the last day of the Test Period, and no Subject Transaction occurring thereafter shall be taken into account.
(c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in paragraph (a) above or in the definition of “Capital Lease”, in the event of an accounting change or a change in the application of GAAP requiring all or certain leases to be
capitalized or otherwise accounted for as liabilities on the balance sheet of the applicable Person, unless the Parent elects otherwise, only those leases (assuming for purposes hereof that such leases were in existence on the date hereof) that would constitute
Capital Leases (including leases that are classified as “Financing Leases” for purposes of GAAP) in conformity with GAAP on the date hereof shall be considered Capital Leases, and all calculations and deliverables under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be made or delivered, as applicable, in accordance therewith.
(d)

For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that by the terms of the Loan Documents requires a calculation of any financial ratio or
69

financial test (including the Total Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Secured Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio and the amount of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated Total Assets), subject to
the succeeding clause (e), such financial ratio or test shall be calculated at the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to
have occurred solely as a result of a change in such financial ratio or financial test occurring after the time such action is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may be.
(e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including in connection with any calculation made on a Pro Forma Basis), if the terms of this Agreement require (i) compliance with any financial ratio or financial test (including,
without limitation, Section 6.15 hereof, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total Leverage Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio test) and/or any cap expressed as a percentage of Consolidated Total Assets or
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) accuracy of any representation or warranty and/or the absence of a Default or Event of Default (or any type of default or event of default) or (iii) compliance with any basket or other condition, as a condition to (A) the
consummation of any transaction (including in connection with any acquisition or similar Investment or the assumption or incurrence of Indebtedness), (B) the making of any Restricted Payment and/or (C) the making of any Restricted Debt Payment, the
determination of whether the relevant condition is satisfied may be made, at the election of the Parent, (1) in the case of any acquisition or similar Investment or any Disposition and any transaction related thereto, at the time of (or on the basis of the financial
statements for the most recently ended Test Period at the time of) either (x) the execution of the definitive agreement with respect to such acquisition, Investment or Disposition (or, solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City
Code on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 Announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer) or (y) the consummation of such acquisition, Investment or Disposition, (2) in the case of any Restricted Payment, at the time of (or
on the basis of the financial statements for the most recently ended Test Period at the time of) (x) the declaration of such Restricted Payment or (y) the making of such Restricted Payment and (3) in the case of any Restricted Debt Payment, at the time of (or
on the basis of the financial statements for the most recently ended Test Period at the time of) (x) delivery of notice with respect to such Restricted Debt Payment or (y) the making of such Restricted Debt Payment, in each case, after giving effect to the
relevant acquisition or similar Investment, Restricted Payment and/or Restricted Debt Payment or other transaction on a Pro Forma Basis (including, in each case, giving effect to the relevant transaction, any relevant Indebtedness (including the intended use
of proceeds thereof) and, at the election of the Parent, giving pro forma effect to other prospective “limited conditionality” acquisitions or similar Investments for which definitive agreements have been executed, and no Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed to have occurred solely as a result of an adverse change in such financial ratio or test occurring after the time such election is made (but any subsequent improvement in the applicable financial ratio or test may be utilized by the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Parent shall have elected the option set forth in clause (x) of any of the preceding clauses (1), (2) or (3) in respect of any transaction, then the Parent or its applicable Restricted Subsidiary shall be
permitted to consummate such transaction even if any applicable test or condition shall cease to be satisfied subsequent to the Parent’s election of such option. The provisions of this paragraph (e) shall also apply in respect of the incurrence of any
Incremental Facility.
(f)

[Reserved].
70

(g)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless the Parent otherwise notifies the Administrative Agent, with respect to any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this
Agreement (other than a borrowing under the Revolving Facility) that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or financial test (including any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total Leverage Ratio test and/or any
Interest Coverage Ratio test) (any such amounts, the “Fixed Amounts”) substantially concurrently with any amounts incurred or transactions entered into (or consummated) in reliance on a provision of this Agreement that requires compliance with a financial
ratio or financial test (including any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total Leverage Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio test) (any such amounts, the “Incurrence-Based Amounts”), it is understood and agreed
that (A) the incurrence of the Incurrence-Based Amount shall be calculated first without giving effect to any Fixed Amount but giving full pro forma effect to the use of proceeds of such Fixed Amount and the related transactions and (B) the incurrence of the
Fixed Amount shall be calculated thereafter. Unless the Parent elects otherwise, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have used amounts under an Incurrence-Based Amount then available to the Borrowers prior to utilization of any amount under a Fixed
Amount then available to the Borrowers.
(h)
The principal amount of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the Parent dated such date
prepared in accordance with GAAP.
(i)
The increase in any amount secured by any Lien by virtue of the accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest or a dividend in the form of additional Indebtedness, amortization of original issue discount
and/or any increase in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of any fluctuation in the exchange rate of any applicable currency and will not be deemed not to be the granting of a Lien for purposes of Section 6.02.
(j)
For purposes of determining compliance with Section 6.01 or Section 6.02, if any Indebtedness or Lien is incurred in reliance on a basket measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, and any refinancing
or replacement thereof would cause the percentage of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to be exceeded if calculated based on the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA on the date of such refinancing or replacement, such percentage of Consolidated Adjusted
EBITDA will be deemed not to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness or other obligation does not exceed an amount sufficient to repay the principal amount of such Indebtedness or other obligation
being refinanced or replaced, except by an amount equal to (x) unpaid accrued interest, penalties and premiums (including tender, prepayment or repayment premiums) thereon plus underwriting discounts and other customary fees, commissions and expenses
(including upfront fees, original issue discount or initial yield payment) incurred in connection with such refinancing or replacement, (y) any existing commitments unutilized thereunder and (z) additional amounts permitted to be incurred under Section 6.01.
(k)
Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Parent pursuant to this Agreement (or required to be satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under this Agreement) shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate
component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).
71
Section 1.05.

Effectuation of Transactions. Each of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (and all corresponding definitions) is made after giving effect to the Transactions, unless the context otherwise requires.

Section 1.06.
Timing of Payment and Performance. When payment of any obligation or the performance of any covenant, duty or obligation is stated to be due or required on a day which is not a Business Day, the date of such payment
(other than as described in the definition of “Interest Period”) or performance shall extend to the immediately succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
Section 1.07.

Times of Day. Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references to New York City time (daylight or standard, as applicable).

Section 1.08.

Currency Equivalents Generally.

(a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clause (b) below, for purposes of any determination under Article 5, Article 6 (other than Section 6.15 and the calculation of compliance with any financial ratio for purposes of taking any
action hereunder) or Article 7 with respect to the amount of any Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment, Restricted Debt Payment, Investment, Disposition, Sale and Lease-Back Transaction, affiliate transaction or other transaction, event or circumstance, or
any determination under any other provision of this Agreement (any of the foregoing, a “relevant transaction”), in a currency other than Dollars, (i) the Dollar equivalent amount of a relevant transaction in a currency other than Dollars shall be calculated
based on the rate of exchange quoted by the Bloomberg Foreign Exchange Rates & World Currencies Page (or any successor page thereto, or in the event such rate does not appear on any Bloomberg Page, by reference to such other publicly available service
for displaying exchange rates as may be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Parent) for such foreign currency, as in effect at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the date of such relevant transaction (which, in the case of any Restricted Payment,
Restricted Debt Payment, Investment, Disposition or incurrence of Indebtedness, shall be determined as set forth in Section 1.04(e)); provided, that if any Indebtedness is incurred (and, if applicable, associated Lien granted) to refinance or replace other
Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Dollars, and the relevant refinancing or replacement would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing or replacement, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness (and, if applicable, associated Lien granted) does not exceed an
amount sufficient to repay the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced or replaced, except by an amount equal to (x) unpaid accrued interest, penalties and premiums (including tender premiums) thereon plus underwriting discounts and other
customary fees, commissions and expenses (including upfront fees, original issue discount or initial yield payment) incurred in connection with such refinancing or replacement, (y) any existing commitments unutilized thereunder and (z) additional amounts
permitted to be incurred under Section 6.01 and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in the rate of currency exchange occurring after the time of any relevant transaction
so long as such relevant transaction was permitted at the time incurred, made, acquired, committed, entered or declared as set forth in clause (i). For purposes of Section 6.15 and the calculation of compliance with any financial ratio for purposes of taking
any action hereunder (including for purposes of calculating compliance
72
with the Incremental Cap) on any relevant date of determination, amounts denominated in currencies other than Dollars shall be translated into Dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate used in preparing the financial statements delivered pursuant to
Sections 5.01(a) or (b) (or, prior to the first such delivery, the financial statements referred to in Section 3.04), as applicable, for the relevant Test Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the Parent would not
be in compliance with Section 6.15 if any Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Dollars were to be translated into Dollars on the basis of the applicable currency exchange rate used in preparing the financial statements delivered pursuant to
Section 5.01(a) or (b), as applicable, for the relevant Test Period, but would be in compliance with Section 6.15 if such Indebtedness that is denominated in a currency other than in Dollars were instead translated into Dollars on the basis of the average
relevant currency exchange rates over such Test Period (taking into account the currency translation effects, determined in accordance with GAAP, of any Hedge Agreement permitted hereunder in respect of currency exchange risks with respect to the
applicable currency in effect on the date of determination for the Dollar equivalent amount of such Indebtedness), then, solely for purposes of compliance with Section 6.15, the First Lien Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such Test Period shall be
calculated on the basis of such average relevant currency exchange rates.

(b)
Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify with the Parent’s consent to appropriately reflect a change in currency of any
country and any relevant market convention or practice relating to such change in currency.
(c)
The Administrative Agent shall determine the Spot Rate as of each Revaluation Date to be used for calculating the Dollar Equivalent amount of any Revolving Loan and/or Letter of Credit that is denominated in any Alternate
Currency. The Spot Rate shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rate employed in converting any amount between any Alternate Currency and Dollars until the next occurring Revaluation Date.
Section 1.09.
Cashless Rollovers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, to the extent that any Lender extends the maturity date of, or replaces, renews or refinances, any of
its then-existing Loans with Incremental Loans, Replacement Term Loans, Loans in connection with any Replacement Revolving Facility, Extended Term Loans, Extended Revolving Loans or loans incurred under a new credit facility, in each case, to the
extent such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing is effected by means of a “cashless roll” by such Lender, such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing shall be deemed to comply with any requirement hereunder or any other Loan
Document that such payment be made “in Dollars”, “in immediately available funds”, “in Cash” or any other similar requirement.
Section 1.10.

Additional Alternate Currencies.

(a)
The Parent may from time to time request that Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans be made to the Borrowers and/or Letters of Credit be issued to the Borrowers in a currency that is not Dollars or an Alternate Currency; provided that
such requested currency is a lawful currency (other than Dollars) that is readily available and freely transferable and convertible into Dollars. In the case of any such request with respect to the making of Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans, such request
shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Lenders of the applicable Class that will provide such Loans, and in the case of any such request with respect to the
73
issuance of Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Banks, in each case as set forth in Section 10.02(b)(ii)(E).
(b)
Any such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., ten Business Days prior to the requested date of the making of such Revolving Loan or issuance of such Letter of Credit (or such other time or
date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the applicable Issuing Banks, in its or their sole discretion). In the case of any such request pertaining to Eurocurrency Rate Revolving
Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender thereof; and in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Issuing Bank thereof. Each applicable
Revolving Lender (in the case of any such request pertaining to Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans) or each applicable Issuing Bank (in the case of a request pertaining to Letters of Credit) shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
five Business Days after receipt of such request whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to the making of Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit, as the case may be, in such requested currency.
(c)
Any failure by a Revolving Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding paragraph shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Revolving Lender or Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, to permit Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans to be made or Letters of Credit to be issued in such requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and all the applicable Revolving Lenders consent to making Eurocurrency Rate
Revolving Loans or issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Parent, and such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternate Currency hereunder for purposes of any
Borrowing of Revolving Loans or issuance of Letters of Credit in such currency, as applicable, in which case the Parent and the Revolving Lenders shall be permitted (but not required) to amend this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as necessary to
accommodate such Borrowings and/or Letters of Credit (as applicable), in accordance with Section 10.02(b)(ii)(E). If the Administrative Agent shall fail to obtain consent to any request for an additional currency under this Section 1.10, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly so notify the Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the Eurocurrency Rate and/or the Alternate Base Rate is not applicable to or available with respect to any Revolving Loan denominated in any
Alternate Currency, the components of the interest rate applicable to such Revolving Loan shall be separately agreed by the Parent and the Administrative Agent.
Section 1.11.
Security Principles. The Collateral Documents, guarantee provisions hereof (including as applied to any Counterpart Agreement), and each other guaranty and security document delivered or to be delivered under this
Agreement and any obligation to enter into such document or obligation in each case by any Subsidiary shall be granted in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles set forth in Schedule 1.01(d).
Section 1.12.

Additional Borrowers.

(a)
From time to time on or after the Closing Date, and with three Business Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may agree), subject to completion of customary “know your
customer” procedures and delivery of related information, the Parent may designate any Subsidiary Guarantor as an additional Borrower (each such person, an “Additional Borrower”) under the Revolving Facility, an Incremental Revolving Facility, an
Additional Revolving Facility or a Replacement Revolving Facility, provided that such person prior
74
to or contemporaneously with becoming an Additional Borrower (i) is incorporated in an Approved Jurisdiction and (ii) in the case of an Additional Borrower under any Incremental Revolving Facility or Additional Revolving Facility, is approved by the
relevant Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders or Additional Revolving Lenders, as applicable.
(b)
Once a person has become an Additional Borrower in accordance with clause (a) above, it (i) shall be a “Borrower” in respect of the applicable Facility and will have the right to request Revolving Loans or Letters of Credit, as the
case may be, in accordance with Article 2 hereof until the earlier to occur of the applicable Maturity Date or the date on which such Additional Borrower resigns as an Additional Borrower in accordance with clause (c) below.
(c)
An Additional Borrower may elect to resign as an Additional Borrower; provided that: (i) no Default or Event of Default is continuing or would result from the resignation of such Additional Borrower, (ii) such resigning Additional
Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent a written notice of resignation and (iii) its obligations in its capacity as Guarantor continue to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect. Upon satisfaction of the requirements in
sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this clause (c), the relevant Additional Borrower shall cease to be an Additional Borrower and a Borrower.
(d)
Each Borrower hereby designates the Parent as its agent and representative. The Parent may act as the agent of any Borrower for the purposes of (i) delivering Borrowing Requests, continuation or conversion notices and other notices
pursuant to Article 2 hereof (and for the purpose of giving instructions with respect to the disbursement of the proceeds of any such Loans or the issuance of any Letters of Credit), (ii) delivering and receiving all other notices, consents, certificates and similar
instruments contemplated hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents and (iii) taking all other actions (including in respect of compliance with covenants and certifications) on behalf of any Borrower under any Loan Document. The Parent hereby
accepts such appointment.
(e)
In respect of a Loan or Loans to a particular Additional Borrower (“Designated Loans”), any Lender (a “Designating Lender”) may at any time and from time to time designate (by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the
Parent): (i) a substitute lending office from which it will make Designated Loans (a “Substitute Facility Office”) or (ii) nominate an Affiliate to act as the Lender of Designated Loans (a “Substitute Affiliate Lender”). A notice to nominate a Substitute
Affiliate Lender must be in the form set out in Exhibit O and be countersigned by the relevant Substitute Affiliate Lender confirming it will be bound as a Lender under this Agreement in respect of the Designated Loans in respect of which it acts as
Substitute Affiliate Lender. The Designating Lender will act as the representative of any Substitute Affiliate Lender it nominates for all administrative purposes under this Agreement. The Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Loan Parties will
be entitled to deal only with the Designating Lender, except that payments will be made in respect of Designated Loans to the lending office of the Substitute Affiliate Lender. In particular the Loans, Commitments, LC Exposure and Swingline Exposure of
the Designating Lender will not be treated as reduced by the introduction of the Substitute Affiliate Lender for voting purposes under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents and the Substitute Affiliate Lender will be treated as having no Loans,
Commitments, LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure for such voting purposes. Save as mentioned in the immediately preceding sentence, a Substitute Affiliate Lender will be treated as a Lender for all purposes under the Loan Documents and having a Loan,
Commitment, LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure equal to the principal amount of all Designated Loans in which it is participating if and for so long as it continues to be a Substitute Affiliate Lender under this Agreement. A Designating Lender may revoke
its designation of an Affiliate as a
75
Substitute Affiliate Lender by notice in writing to the Administrative Agent and provided that such notice may only take effect when there are no Designated Loans outstanding to the Substitute Affiliate Lender. Upon such Substitute Affiliate Lender ceasing
to be a Substitute Affiliate Lender the Designating Lender will automatically assume (and be deemed to assume without further action by any party) all rights and obligations previously vested in the Substitute Affiliate Lender. If a Designating Lender
designates a Substitute Facility Office or Substitute Affiliate Lender in accordance with this clause (e): (i) any Substitute Affiliate Lender shall be treated for the purposes of Section 2.17 as having become a Lender on the date of this Agreement and (ii) the
provisions of Section 10.05 shall not apply to or in respect of any Substitute Facility Office or Substitute Affiliate Lender.

that it determines would result in increased costs for which it will not be compensated hereunder or that it otherwise determines would be disadvantageous to it and in the event of such request for costs for which compensation is provided under this
Agreement, the provisions of Section 2.15 shall apply); provided, further, that any such domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender shall not be entitled to any greater indemnification under Section 2.17 with respect to such Eurocurrency Rate

77
(c)
At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing, such Borrowing shall comprise an aggregate principal amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000 (or the Dollar

greater number of different Interest Periods as the Administrative Agent may agree from time to time).
(d)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower shall, nor shall any Borrower be entitled to, request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would
end after the Maturity Date applicable to such Loans.
Section 2.03.
Requests for Borrowings. Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans shall be made upon irrevocable notice by the
applicable Borrower to the Administrative Agent (provided that notices in respect of any Borrowings to be made in connection with any acquisition, Investment or irrevocable repayment, redemption or refinancing of Indebtedness may be conditioned on the
closing of such acquisition, Investment or irrevocable repayment, redemption or refinancing of such Indebtedness). Each such notice must be in writing and must be received by the Administrative Agent (by hand delivery, fax or other electronic transmission
(including “.pdf” or “.tif”)) not later than 1:00 p.m. (i) three Business Days prior to the requested day of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans (or one Business Day in the case of any Borrowing of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans to be made on the Closing Date) and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans (other than Swingline Loans) or Canadian Prime Rate Loans (or, in each case, such later time as
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent); provided, however, that if the applicable Borrower wishes to request Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans having an Interest Period of other than one, two, three or six months in duration as
provided in the definition of “Interest Period,” (A) the applicable notice from the applicable Borrower must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. four Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or
continuation (or such later time as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the appropriate Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is
available to them and (B) not later than 10:00 a.m. three Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower whether or not the requested Interest Period is
available to the appropriate Lenders. Each written notice with respect to a Borrowing by the applicable Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be delivered to the Administrative
78
Agent in the form of a written Borrowing Request, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower. Each such Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

the location and number of the applicable Borrower’s account or any other designated account(s) to which funds are to be disbursed (the “Funding Account”).

If, with respect to a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If, with respect to a Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars, no election as to the
Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be a Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or BA Rate Borrowing, then the applicable Borrower shall
be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. The Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of the Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing (x) in the case of any ABR
Borrowing or Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing, on the same Business Day of receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section or (y) in the case of any Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or BA Rate Borrowing, no later than one Business Day
following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section.
Section 2.04.

Swingline Loans.

(a)
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans in Dollars to any Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not to exceed $50,000,000; provided that (x) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make any Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan and (y) after giving effect to any Swingline Loan, the aggregate Outstanding
Amount of all Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and LC Exposure shall not exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment. Each Swingline Loan shall be in a minimum principal amount of not less than $100,000 or such lesser amount as may be agreed
by the Swingline Lender; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, a Swingline Loan may be in an aggregate amount that is (x) equal to the entire unused balance of the aggregate Unused Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) required to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e). Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Swingline Loans
79
may be borrowed, prepaid and reborrowed. To request a Swingline Loan, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Swingline Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such request in writing, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day of a proposed
Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the applicable
Borrower on the same Business Day by means of a credit to the Funding Account or otherwise in accordance with the instructions of the applicable Borrower (including, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank).
(b)
The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. on any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on the second Business Day following receipt of
such notice in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give
notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as
provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or any reduction or termination of the Revolving
Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.04(b)),
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower of any participation in any Swingline Loan acquired
pursuant to this Section 2.04(b), and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the applicable Borrower (or other
Person on behalf of the applicable Borrower) in respect of any Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of any sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted by the Swingline Lender to the Administrative Agent and any
such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that have made their payments pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear;
provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and thereafter to the applicable Borrower, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the applicable
Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in any Swingline Loan pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.
(c)
If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04
by the time specified in Section 2.04(b), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date
80
such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (c) shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.
Section 2.05.

Letters of Credit.

(a)
General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) each Issuing Bank agrees, in each case in reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in this Section 2.05, (A) from time to time on any

issued on sight basis only for the account of the applicable Borrower (or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that a Borrower will be the applicant) and to amend or renew Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.05(b) and (B) to
honor drafts under the Letters of Credit and (ii) the Revolving Lenders severally agree to participate in the Letters of Credit issued pursuant to Section 2.05(d); provided, further, that after giving effect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit, (w) the aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitments, (x) the LC Exposure of each Revolving Lender shall not exceed such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment, (y) the Outstanding
Amount of the LC Exposure shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the Letters of Credit issued by any Issuing Bank shall not exceed such Issuing Bank’s Letter of Credit Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue Commercial Letters of Credit without its consent.
(ii)
No Issuing Bank shall have an obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if (x) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank
from issuing such Letter of Credit, (y) customary “know your customer” requirements of such Issuing Bank with respect to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit would be violated or (z) any law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or direct that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such
Letter of Credit in particular.
(b)
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall deliver to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent, at least three
Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance (or such shorter period as is acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank or, in the case of any issuance to be made on the Closing Date, one Business Day prior to the Closing Date), a request to issue a
Letter of Credit, which shall specify that it is being issued under this Agreement, in the form of Exhibit K attached hereto. To request an amendment, extension or renewal of a Letter of Credit (other than any automatic extension of a Letter of Credit
permitted under Section 2.05(c)), the applicable Borrower shall submit such a request to the applicable Issuing Bank selected by the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least three Business Days in advance of the requested date

81
acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank), identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, extended or renewed, and specifying the proposed date (which shall be a Business Day) and other details of the amendment, extension or renewal. Requests for the
issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of any Letter of Credit must be accompanied by such other information required by the applicable Issuing Bank as shall be necessary to issue, amend, extend or renew such Letter of Credit. If requested by the
applicable Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the applicable Borrower to, or entered into by the applicable Borrower with, the applicable Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. No Letter of Credit, letter of credit application or other document entered into by the applicable Borrower with any Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit shall contain any representations or
warranties, covenants or events of default not set forth in this Agreement (and to the extent inconsistent herewith shall be rendered null and void or reformed automatically without further action by any Person to conform to the terms of this Agreement), and
all representations and warranties, covenants and events of default set forth therein shall contain standards, qualifications, thresholds and exceptions for materiality or otherwise consistent with those set forth in this Agreement (and, to the extent inconsistent
herewith, shall be deemed to automatically incorporate the applicable standards, qualifications, thresholds and exceptions set forth herein without action by any Person). A Letter of Credit may be issued, amended, extended or renewed only if (and on the
issuance, amendment, extension or renewal of each Letter of Credit the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension or renewal, the Initial Revolving Credit Exposure would
not exceed the Initial Revolving Credit Commitment. In addition, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, extend or renew any Letter of Credit if the expiration date of such Letter of Credit extends beyond the Maturity Date applicable to the
Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class unless (1) the aggregate amount of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit expiring after such Maturity Date does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect
that are scheduled to remain in effect after such Maturity Date, (2) all Revolving Lenders and such Issuing Bank shall have consented to such expiry date, (3) the applicable Borrower shall have caused such Letter of Credit to be backstopped by a “back to
back” letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or (4) the applicable Borrower shall have caused such Letter of Credit to be Cash collateralized in accordance with Section 2.05(j), in the case of clause (3) or (4) on or before the date that
such Letter of Credit is issued, amended, extended or renewed beyond such date. Promptly after the delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable
Issuing Bank will also deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. Upon receipt of such Letter of Credit or amendment, the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Revolving Lenders, in writing, of such Letter of Credit or amendment, and if so requested by a Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent will provide such Revolving Lender with copies of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
(c)

(i)
Except as set forth in Section 2.05(b), no Standby Letter of Credit shall expire later than the earlier of (A) the date that is one year after the date of the issuance of such Standby Letter of Credit (or such later date to
which the relevant Issuing Bank may agree) and (B) five (5) Business Days prior to the Latest Revolving Loan Maturity Date;
82
provided that, any Standby Letter of Credit may provide for the automatic extension thereof for any number of additional periods each of up to one year in duration (none of which, in any event, shall extend beyond the date referred to in the
preceding clause (B) unless 100% of the then-available face amount thereof is Cash collateralized or backstopped on or before the date that such Letter of Credit is extended beyond the date referred to in clause (B) above pursuant to
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Bank).
(ii)
Except as set forth in Section 2.05(b), no Commercial Letter of Credit shall expire later than the earlier to occur of (A) one year after the issuance thereof (or such later date to which the relevant Issuing Bank may

year in duration (none of which, in any event, shall extend beyond the date referred to in the preceding clause (B) unless 100% of the then-available face amount thereof is Cash collateralized or backstopped on or before the date that such
Letter of Credit is extended beyond the date referred to in clause (B) above pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Bank).
(d)
Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the
applicable Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (in respect of any Letter of Credit issued in any Alternate Currency, expressed in the Dollar Equivalent thereof). In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely
and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the
date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or
Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(e)

Reimbursement.

(i)
If the applicable Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of
Commercial Letters of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank) an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately following the date on which the applicable Borrower receives notice under
paragraph (g) of this Section of such LC Disbursement (or, if such notice is received less than two hours prior to the deadline for requesting ABR Borrowings pursuant to Section 2.03, on the second Business Day immediately
83
following the date on which the applicable Borrower receives such notice); provided that the applicable Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such
payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Loan or a Swingline Loan and, to the extent so financed, the applicable Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Revolving Loan
Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the applicable Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the applicable
Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment
then due from the applicable Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving
Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the
applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse
such Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.
(ii)
If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.05(e) by the time specified therein, such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the
period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate (or, in the case of any Letter of
Credit denominated in any Alternate Currency, the Administrative Agent’s customary rate for interbank advances in such Alternate Currency) from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of the applicable Issuing Bank submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (ii) shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.
(f)
Obligations Absolute. The applicable Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein or herein, (ii) any draft or other document
presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a
draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
84
Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the applicable Borrower’s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their respective Related
Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in
interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower to the extent of any
direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the applicable Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the applicable Borrower that are caused by
such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct on the part of applicable Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting
the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make
payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms
of such Letter of Credit.
(g)
Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower in writing of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that no failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall
relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(h)
Interim Interest. If any Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear
interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the applicable Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement (or the date on which such LC Disbursement is reimbursed with the proceeds of
Loans, as applicable), at the rate per annum then applicable to (x) in the case of any Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars, Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans, (y) in the case of any Letter of Credit denominated in Canadian Dollars, Revolving Loans that
are Canadian Prime Rate Loans and (z) in the case of any Letter of Credit denominated in any other Alternate Currency, Revolving Loans that are Eurocurrency Rate Loans with an Interest Period of one month; provided that if the applicable Borrower fails to
reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after
the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to the extent of such payment.
85
(i)
Replacement of an Issuing Bank or Addition of New Issuing Banks. Any Issuing Bank may be replaced with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Parent and the successor Issuing
Bank at any time by written agreement among the Parent, the Administrative Agent and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement
becomes effective, the applicable Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b)(ii). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all
the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing
Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of any Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit after such replacement. The Parent may, at any time and from time to time with the
consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the relevant Revolving Lender, designate one or more additional Revolving Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement. Any
Revolving Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph (i) shall be deemed to be an “Issuing Bank” (in addition to being a Revolving Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Revolving Lender, and, with
respect to such Letters of Credit, such term shall thereafter apply to the other Issuing Bank and such Revolving Lender.
(j)

Cash Collateralization.

(i)
If any Event of Default exists and the Revolving Loans have been declared due and payable in accordance with Article 7 hereof, then on the Business Day that the Parent receives notice from the Administrative Agent
at the direction of the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of Cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph (j), upon such demand, the applicable Borrower shall deposit, in an interest-bearing account with the Administrative Agent, in the
name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the “LC Collateral Account”), an amount in Cash equal to 100% of the LC Exposure as of such date (minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral
Account); provided that the obligation to deposit such Cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of
any Event of Default with respect to the Parent described in Section 8.01(f) or (g).
(ii)
Any such deposit under clause (i) above shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (j). The
Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account, and the applicable Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a
First Priority security interest in the LC Collateral Account. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable
Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
86
obligations of the applicable Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders) be applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the
applicable Borrower is required to provide an amount of Cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (together with all interest and other earnings with respect thereto, to the extent not applied
as aforesaid) shall be returned to the applicable Borrower promptly but in no event later than three Business Days after such Event of Default has been cured or waived.
(k)
Existing Letters of Credit. Each Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed a Letter of Credit issued hereunder for all purposes under this Agreement without need for any further action by the Borrowers or any other Person (but giving
effect to the reallocation of applicant status as set forth in the Restatement Agreement).
(l)
Reporting. Not later than the third Business Day following the last day of each month and on the date of any issuance of any Letter of Credit (or at such other intervals as the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank shall
agree), each Issuing Bank shall provide to the Administrative Agent a schedule of the Letters of Credit issued by it, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, showing the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit, the account
party, the original face amount (if any), the expiration date, and the reference number of any Letter of Credit outstanding at any time during such month, and showing the aggregate amount (if any) payable by each Borrower to such Issuing Bank during such
month.
Section 2.06.

[Reserved].

Section 2.07.

Funding of Borrowings.

(a)
Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m. to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for
such purpose by notice to the Lenders in an amount equal to such Lender’s respective Applicable Percentage; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the Funding Account or as otherwise directed by the applicable Borrower or the Parent; provided that Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of any LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
(b)
Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from any Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount.
In such event, if any Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
(without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of
such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate (or, with respect to any amount denominated in any Alternate Currency, the rate of
87
interest per annum at which overnight deposits in the applicable Alternate Currency, in an amount that is approximately equal to the amount with respect to which such rate is being determined, would be offered for such day by the Administrative Agent in
the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency) and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the Loans
comprising such Borrowing at such time. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing and the applicable Borrower’s obligation to repay the Administrative
Agent such corresponding amount pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) shall cease. If the applicable Borrower pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, the amount so paid shall constitute a repayment of such Borrowing by such amount. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the applicable Borrower or any other Loan Party may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such
Lender hereunder.
Section 2.08.

Type; Interest Elections.

(a)
Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or BA Rate Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type available in such currency or to continue any Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or BA Rate
Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among
the Lenders based upon their Applicable Percentages and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued.
(b)
To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall deliver an Interest Election Request (by hand delivery, fax or other electronic transmission (including “.pdf” or “.tif”)), appropriately completed and signed
by a Responsible Officer of the applicable Borrower, of the applicable election to the Administrative Agent by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the applicable Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type
resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or a BA Rate Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall
be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
(c)

Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.

(d)
If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or BA Rate Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing
is repaid as provided herein, such Borrowing shall be converted at the end of such Interest Period to a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or BA Rate Borrowing, as applicable, with an Interest Period of one month. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof,
if an Event of Default exists and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
88
Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default exists (i) no outstanding Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the then-current Interest Period applicable thereto.
(e)
It is understood and agreed that (i) only a Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be made as, or converted to, an ABR Loan, (ii) only a Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars may be made as, or converted to, a Canadian
Prime Rate Loan or a BA Rate Loan and (iii) a Borrowing denominated in an Alternate Currency other than Canadian Dollars may only be made as, or converted to, or continued as, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan (or such other type of Revolving Loan as may be
agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower pursuant to Section 1.10).
Section 2.09.

Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

(a)
Unless previously terminated, (i) the Initial Term Loan Commitments on the Closing Date shall automatically terminate upon the making of the Initial Term Loans on the Closing Date, (ii) the Initial Revolving Credit Commitments
shall automatically terminate on the Initial Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (iii) the Additional Term Loan Commitments of any Class shall automatically terminate upon the making of the Additional Term Loans of such Class and, if any such Additional
Term Loan Commitment is not drawn on the date that such Additional Term Loan Commitment is required to be drawn pursuant to the applicable Refinancing Amendment, Extension Amendment or Incremental Facility Amendment, the undrawn amount
thereof shall terminate unless otherwise provided in the applicable Refinancing Amendment, Extension Amendment or Incremental Facility Amendment and (iv) the Additional Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall automatically terminate on
the Maturity Date specified therefor in the applicable Refinancing Amendment, Extension Amendment or Incremental Facility Amendment.
(b)
Upon delivering the notice required by Section 2.09(c), the Parent may at any time terminate or from time to time reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Credit
Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) the Parent shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class if, after giving effect to such termination
or reduction, as applicable, and any concurrent prepayment of Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposure attributable to the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class would exceed the aggregate
amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class; provided that, after the establishment of any Additional Revolving Credit Commitment, any such termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall be subject to
the provisions set forth in Section 2.22, 2.23 and/or 10.02, as applicable.
(c)
The Parent shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce any Class or Classes of Revolving Credit Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section (as selected by the Parent) not later than 1:00 p.m. on
or prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction (or not later than 1:00 p.m., three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, in the case of a termination or reduction involving a prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate
Borrowings or BA Rate Borrowings (or such later date to which the Administrative Agent may agree)), specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
Revolving Lenders of each applicable Class or Classes of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Parent pursuant
89
to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that any such notice may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other transactions, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Parent (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior
to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of any Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall be permanent. Upon any reduction of any Revolving Credit Commitment, the Revolving
Credit Commitment of each Revolving Lender of the relevant Class shall be reduced by such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such reduction amount.
Section 2.10.

a result of any increase in the amount of such First Incremental Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.22(a)), (iii) on the Initial Term Loan Maturity Date, in an amount equal to the remainder of the principal amount of the Initial Term Loans outstanding on such
date, together in each case with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment and (iv) on the First Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date, in an amount equal to the remainder of the principal amount

to Section 2.22(a)).
(b)

Borrower on the Initial Revolving Credit Maturity Date, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Additional Revolving Lender, the then-unpaid principal amount of each Additional Revolving Loan of such Additional Revolving Lender made

Initial Revolving Facility then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest (if any) thereon attributable to such Borrower.
(c)
If the Maturity Date in respect of any Class of Revolving Credit Commitments occurs prior to the expiry date of any Letter of Credit, then (i) if one or more other Classes of Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of which the
Maturity Date shall not have so occurred are then in effect (or will automatically be in effect upon the occurrence of such Maturity Date), such Letters of Credit shall automatically be deemed to have been issued (including for purposes of the obligations of
the Revolving Lenders to purchase participations therein and to make Revolving Loans and payments in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.05(d) and Section 2.05(e)) under (and ratably participated in by Revolving Lenders pursuant to) the non-terminating
or new Classes of Revolving Credit Commitments up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of the unutilized Revolving Credit Commitments continuing at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any
Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) (in each case, after giving effect to any repayments of Revolving Loans) and (ii) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to immediately preceding clause (i) and unless provisions reasonably satisfactory to the applicable
Issuing Bank for the treatment of such Letter of Credit as a letter of credit under a successor credit facility have been agreed upon, the applicable Borrower shall, on or prior to the applicable Maturity Date, (x) cause such Letter of Credit to be replaced and

of the Parent, the Letter of Credit Sublimit immediately following such Maturity Date shall be no less than the Letter of Credit Sublimit immediately prior to such Maturity Date multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of the
Revolving Credit Commitments immediately following such Maturity Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments immediately prior to such Maturity Date.
(d)

failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any manifest error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the applicable Borrowers to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
91
provided, further, that in the event of any inconsistency between the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section and any Lender’s records, the accounts of the Administrative Agent shall govern.

provided that a notice of
92
prepayment delivered by the applicable Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other transactions or other conditional events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the applicable Borrower (by
notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied and/or the applicable Borrower may delay or rescind such notice until such condition is satisfied. Promptly following receipt of
any such notice relating to any Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the relevant Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a

Term Loans specified by the applicable Borrower in the applicable prepayment notice, and each prepayment of Term Loans of such Class or Classes made pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) shall be applied against the remaining scheduled
installments of principal due in respect of the Term Loans of such Class or Classes in the manner specified by the applicable Borrower or, if not so specified on or prior to the date of such optional prepayment, in direct order of maturity.

December 31, 2018, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay Subject Loans in accordance with clause (vi) below in an aggregate principal amount (the “ECF Prepayment Amount”) equal to (A) the Required Excess Cash Flow Percentage of
Excess Cash Flow of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the Excess Cash Flow Period then most recently ended (this clause (A), the “Base ECF Prepayment Amount”) minus (B) at the option of the Parent, to the extent occurring
during such Excess Cash Flow Period (or occurring after such Excess Cash Flow Period and prior to the date of the applicable Excess Cash Flow payment), and without duplication (including duplication of any amounts deducted in any
prior Excess Cash Flow Period), the following (collectively, the “ECF Deductions”):
(1)

the aggregate principal amount of any Term Loans and Revolving Loans prepaid pursuant to Section 2.11(a);

(2)
the aggregate principal amount of any Incremental Equivalent Debt, Replacement Debt and/or any other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to Section 6.01 to the extent
secured by Liens on the Collateral that are pari passu with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Credit Facilities, voluntarily prepaid, repurchased, redeemed or otherwise retired (or contractually
committed to be prepaid, repurchased, redeemed or otherwise retired); and

the amount of any reduction in the outstanding amount of any Term Loans, Incremental Equivalent Debt, Replacement Debt and/or any other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred
pursuant to Section 6.01 to the extent secured by Liens on the Collateral that are pari

passu with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Credit Facilities, resulting from any purchase or assignment made in accordance with Section 10.05(g) of this Agreement (including in connection with
any Dutch Auction) (with respect to Term Loans) and any equivalent provisions with respect to any Incremental Equivalent Debt, Replacement Debt and/or such other Indebtedness;
in the case of each of clauses (1)-(3), (I) excluding any such payments, prepayments and expenditures made during such Fiscal Year that reduced the amount required to be prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.11(b)(i) in the prior Fiscal Year,
(II) in the case of any prepayment of revolving Indebtedness, to the extent accompanied by a permanent reduction in the relevant commitment, (III) to the extent that such payments, prepayments and expenditures were not financed with the
proceeds of other long-term funded Indebtedness (other than revolving Indebtedness) of the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries and (IV) in each case under clause (3) above, based upon the actual amount of cash paid in connection with
any relevant purchase or assignment; provided that no prepayment under this Section 2.11(b)(i) shall be required unless the principal amount of Subject Loans required to be prepaid exceeds $50,000,000 (and, in such case, only such amount
in excess of $50,000,000 shall be required to be prepaid); provided, further, that if at the time that any such prepayment would be required, the Parent (or any Restricted Subsidiary) is also required to prepay, repurchase or offer to prepay or
repurchase any Indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis (without regard to the control of remedies) with any Secured Obligation pursuant to the terms of the documentation governing such Indebtedness (such Indebtedness required
to be so prepaid or repurchased or offered to be so prepaid or repurchased, “Other Applicable Indebtedness”) with any portion of the ECF Prepayment Amount, then the applicable Borrowers may apply such portion of the ECF
Prepayment Amount on a pro rata basis (determined on the basis of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Subject Loans and the relevant Other Applicable Indebtedness (or accreted amount if such Other Applicable
Indebtedness is issued with original issue discount) at such time) to the prepayment of the Subject Loans and to the prepayment of the relevant Other Applicable Indebtedness, and the amount of prepayment of the Subject Loans that would
have otherwise been required pursuant to this Section 2.11(b)(i) shall be reduced accordingly; it being understood that (1) the portion of such ECF Prepayment Amount allocated to the Other Applicable Indebtedness shall not exceed the
portion of such ECF Prepayment Amount required to be allocated to the Other Applicable Indebtedness pursuant to the terms thereof, and the remaining amount, if any, of such ECF Prepayment Amount shall be allocated to the Subject
Loans in accordance with the terms hereof and (2) to the extent the holders of the Other Applicable Indebtedness decline to have such Indebtedness prepaid or repurchased, the declined amount shall promptly (and in any event within ten
Business Days after the date of such rejection) be applied to prepay the Subject Loans in accordance with the terms hereof.
(ii)
No later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt of Net Proceeds in respect of any Prepayment Asset Sale or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds that are Material Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, in
each case, in excess of $200,000,000 in any Fiscal Year (disregarding Net Proceeds of up to $75,000,000 received in respect of
94
Exclusive Licenses in such Fiscal Year), the applicable Borrowers shall apply an amount equal to the Required Net Proceeds Percentage of such Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds received with respect thereto in excess
of such thresholds (collectively, the “Subject Proceeds”; and any Net Proceeds in respect of any Prepayment Asset Sale or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds that do not constitute Subject Proceeds, the “Excluded Proceeds”) to
prepay the outstanding principal amount of Subject Loans in accordance with clause (vi) below; provided that (A) the Borrowers shall not be required to make a mandatory prepayment under this clause (ii) in respect of the Subject Proceeds
that are reinvested in assets used or useful in the business of any Borrower or its Subsidiaries (including acquisitions and Investments) to the extent (x) the Subject Proceeds are so reinvested within 12 months following receipt thereof (the
“Reinvestment Period”) or (y) the Parent or any of its subsidiaries has contractually committed to so reinvest the Subject Proceeds during such Reinvestment Period and the Subject Proceeds are so reinvested within six months after the
expiration of such Reinvestment Period; provided, however, that if the Subject Proceeds have not been so reinvested prior to the expiration of the applicable period, the applicable Borrowers shall promptly prepay the outstanding principal
amount of Subject Loans with the Subject Proceeds not so reinvested as set forth above (without regard to the immediately preceding proviso) (provided that the Parent may elect to deem certain expenditures that would otherwise be
permissible reinvestments but that occurred prior to the receipt of the applicable Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds (as applicable) as having been reinvested in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.11(b)(ii),
but only to the extent such deemed expenditure shall have been made no earlier than (x) in the case of Net Proceeds, the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to such Prepayment Asset Sale or the consummation of
the applicable Disposition and (y) in the case of Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, the occurrence of the event in respect of which such Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds were received) and (B) if, at the time that any such
prepayment would be required hereunder, the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is required to repay or repurchase (or offer to repay or repurchase) any Other Applicable Indebtedness, then the relevant Person may apply the Subject
Proceeds on a pro rata basis to the prepayment of the Subject Loans and to the repurchase or repayment of the Other Applicable Indebtedness (determined on the basis of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Subject Loans and
the Other Applicable Indebtedness (or accreted amount if such Other Applicable Indebtedness is issued with original issue discount) at such time); it being understood that (1) the portion of the Subject Proceeds allocated to the Other
Applicable Indebtedness shall not exceed the amount of the Subject Proceeds required to be allocated to the Other Applicable Indebtedness pursuant to the terms thereof (and the remaining amount, if any, of the Subject Proceeds shall be
allocated to the Subject Loans in accordance with the terms hereof), and the amount of the prepayment of the Subject Loans that would have otherwise been required pursuant to this Section 2.11(b)(ii) shall be reduced accordingly and (2) to
the extent the holders of the Other Applicable Indebtedness decline to have such Indebtedness prepaid or repurchased, the declined amount shall promptly (and in any event within ten Business Days after the date of such rejection) be
applied to prepay the Subject Loans in accordance with the terms hereof.
95
(iii)
In the event that the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries receives Net Proceeds from the issuance or incurrence of Indebtedness by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than with respect to
Indebtedness permitted under Section 6.01, except to the extent the relevant Indebtedness constitutes Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Initial Term Loans pursuant to Section 6.01(p) or Replacement Term
Loans incurred to refinance Initial Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.02(c)), the applicable Borrowers shall, substantially simultaneously with (and in any event not later than two Business Days thereafter) the
receipt of such Net Proceeds by the Parent or its applicable Restricted Subsidiary, apply an amount equal to 100% of such Net Proceeds to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the relevant Initial Term Loans in accordance with clause
(vi) below;
(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.11(b) to the contrary, (A) the Borrowers shall not be required to prepay any amount that would otherwise be required to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.11(b)(i) or (ii) above
to the extent that the relevant Excess Cash Flow is generated by any Foreign Subsidiary, the relevant Prepayment Asset Sale is consummated by any Foreign Subsidiary or the relevant Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds are received by
any Foreign Subsidiary, as the case may be, for so long as the Parent determines in good faith that the repatriation to the applicable Borrower of any such amount would be prohibited or delayed (beyond the time period during which such
prepayment is otherwise required to be made pursuant to Section 2.11(b)(i) or (ii) above) under any Requirement of Law or conflict with the fiduciary duties of such Foreign Subsidiary’s directors, or result in, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management or consultant of such Foreign Subsidiary (including on account of financial assistance, corporate
benefit, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar considerations); it being understood and agreed that (i) solely within 365 days following the end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period or the event giving rise to the relevant
Subject Proceeds, the applicable Borrower shall take all commercially reasonable actions required by applicable Requirements of Law to permit such repatriation and (ii) if the repatriation of the relevant affected Excess Cash Flow or
Subject Proceeds, as the case may be, is permitted under the applicable Requirement of Law and, to the extent applicable, would no longer conflict with the fiduciary duties of such director, or result in, or be reasonably expected to result in,
a material risk of personal or criminal liability for the Persons described above, in either case, within 365 days following the end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period or the event giving rise to the relevant Subject Proceeds, the
relevant Foreign Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds, as the case may be, and the repatriated Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds, as the case may be, will be promptly (and in any event
not later than two Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against such Excess Cash Flow or such Subject Proceeds, as a result thereof, in each case by any Loan Party, such Loan Party’s
subsidiaries, and any Affiliates or indirect or direct equity owners of the foregoing) to the repayment of Subject Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) to the extent required herein (without regard to this clause (iv)), (B) the Borrowers shall
not be required to prepay any amount that would otherwise be required to be paid pursuant to Sections 2.11(b)(i) or (ii) to the extent that the relevant Excess Cash Flow is generated
96
by any Joint Venture or the relevant Subject Proceeds are received by any Joint Venture for so long as the Parent determines in good faith that the distribution to the applicable Borrowers of such Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds would
be prohibited under the Organizational Documents (or any relevant shareholders’ or similar agreement) governing such Joint Venture; it being understood that if the relevant prohibition ceases to exist within the 365-day period following the
end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period, the event giving rise to the relevant Subject Proceeds, the relevant Joint Venture will promptly distribute the relevant Excess Cash Flow or the relevant Subject Proceeds, as the case may be,
and the distributed Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds, as the case may be, will be promptly (and in any event not later than ten Business Days after such distribution) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a
result thereof) to the repayment of Subject Loans pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) to the extent required herein (without regard to this clause (iv)) and (C) if the Parent determines in good faith that the repatriation (or other intercompany
distribution) to the applicable Borrower of any amounts required to mandatorily prepay the Subject Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b)(i) or (ii) above would result in material and adverse tax consequences for any Loan Party or any of such
Loan Party’s subsidiaries, Affiliates or indirect or direct equity owners, taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation (such amount, a “Restricted Amount”), as determined by the
Parent in good faith, the amount the applicable Borrower shall be required to mandatorily prepay pursuant to Section 2.11(b)(i) or (ii) above, as applicable, shall be reduced by the Restricted Amount; provided that to the extent that the
repatriation (or other intercompany distribution) of any Subject Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow from the relevant Foreign Subsidiary would no longer have a material and adverse tax consequence within the 365-day period following the
event giving rise to the relevant Subject Proceeds or the end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period, as the case may be, an amount equal to the Subject Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, as applicable, not previously applied pursuant to
this clause (C), shall be promptly applied to the repayment of Subject Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b) as otherwise required above (without regard to this clause (iv));
(v)
Each Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent at or prior to the time and in the manner specified by the Administrative Agent, prior to any prepayment of Initial Term Loans and Additional Term
Loans required to be made by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.11(b), to decline all (but not a portion) of its Applicable Percentage of such prepayment (such declined amounts, the “Declined Proceeds”), which Declined Proceeds may
be retained by the applicable Borrower and used for any legal purpose permitted (or not prohibited) hereunder, including to increase the Available Amount; provided further that, for the avoidance of doubt, no Lender may reject any
prepayment made under Section 2.11(b)(iii) above to the extent that such prepayment is made with the Net Proceeds of (w) Refinancing Indebtedness (including Replacement Debt) incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Initial Term
Loans or Additional Term Loans pursuant to Section 6.01(p), (x) Incremental Term Loans incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.22, (y) Replacement Term Loans incurred to refinance all or a portion
of the Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.02(c) and/or (z) Incremental Equivalent Debt incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of
97
Section 6.01(z). If any Lender fails to deliver a notice to the Administrative Agent of its election to decline receipt of its Applicable Percentage of any mandatory prepayment within the time frame specified by the Administrative Agent,
such failure will be deemed to constitute an acceptance of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the total amount of such mandatory prepayment of Initial Term Loans and Additional Term Loans.
(vi) Except as may otherwise be set forth in any amendment to this Agreement in connection with any Additional Term Loan, (A) each prepayment of Initial Term Loans and Additional Term Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.11(b) shall be applied ratably to each Class of Term Loans (based upon the then outstanding principal amounts of the respective Classes of Term Loans) (provided that any prepayment constituting (w) Refinancing Indebtedness
(including Replacement Debt) incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Initial Term Loans or Additional Term Loans pursuant to Section 6.01(p), (x) Incremental Loans incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to
Section 2.22, (y) Replacement Term Loans incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.02(c) and/or (z) Incremental Equivalent Debt incurred to refinance all or a portion of the
Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of Section 6.01(z) shall, in each case be applied solely to each applicable Class of refinanced or replaced Term Loans), (B) with respect to each Class of Initial Term Loans and Additional
Term Loans, all accepted prepayments under Section 2.11(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) shall be applied against the remaining scheduled installments of principal due in respect of the Initial Term Loans and Additional Term Loans as directed by the
Parent (or, in the absence of direction from the Parent, to the remaining scheduled amortization payments in respect of the Initial Term Loans and Additional Term Loans in direct order of maturity) and (C) each such prepayment shall be
paid to the Term Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. The amount of such mandatory prepayments shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the then outstanding Initial Term Loans and Additional Term Loans
being prepaid irrespective of whether such outstanding Loans are ABR Loans, Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Loans of any other Type. Any prepayment of Initial Term Loans made on or prior to the Soft Call Termination Date pursuant to
Section 2.11(b)(iii) as part of a Repricing Transaction shall be accompanied by the fee set forth in Section 2.12(f).
(vii)
In the event that on any Revaluation Date (after giving effect to the determination of the Outstanding Amount of each Revolving Loan, Letter of Credit and LC Disbursement) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any
Class exceeds the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class then in effect, the applicable Borrowers shall, within five Business Days of receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent, prepay the Revolving Loans or
Swingline Loans and/or reduce LC Exposure in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Revolving Credit Exposure as of the date of such payment to an amount not to exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class then in
effect by taking any of the following actions as it shall determine at its sole discretion: (A) prepaying Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans or (B) with respect to any excess LC Exposure, depositing Cash in the LC Collateral Account or
“backstopping” or replacing the relevant Letters of Credit, in each case, in an amount equal to 100% of such excess LC Exposure (minus any amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account).
98
(viii)
At the time of each prepayment required under Section 2.11(b)(i), (ii) or (iii), the Parent shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the Parent setting forth in reasonable
detail the calculation of the amount of such prepayment in the form attached as Exhibit M hereto. Each such certificate shall specify the Borrowings being prepaid and the principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof) to be
prepaid. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest as required by Section 2.13. All prepayments of Borrowings under this Section 2.11(b) shall be subject to Section 2.16 and, except as set forth in the last sentence of clause
(vi) above, shall otherwise be without premium or penalty.
Section 2.12.

Fees.

(a)
The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender of any Class (other than any Defaulting Lender) a commitment fee, which shall accrue at a rate equal to the Commitment Fee Rate
per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class on the average daily amount of the Unused Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class of such Revolving Lender during the period from and including the Closing Date to the date
on which such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December for the quarterly period then ended (commencing
on June 29, 2018) but in the case of the payment made on such date, for the period from the Closing Date to such date) and on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Class terminate. For purposes of calculating the
commitment fees only, no portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be deemed utilized as a result of outstanding Swingline Loans.
(b)
The Borrowers agree to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender of any Class (other than any Defaulting Lender) a participation fee with respect to its participation in each Letter of Credit, which
shall accrue at the Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans on the daily face amount of such Lender’s LC Exposure attributable to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class in respect of such
Letter of Credit (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements), during the period from and including the Closing Date to the later of the date on which such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class
terminates and the date on which such Revolving Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure related to its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class in respect of such Letter of Credit (including any such LC Exposure that may exist following the termination
of such Revolving Credit Commitments) and (ii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own account, a fronting fee, in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the period from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to the expiration date of
such Letter of Credit (or if terminated on an earlier date, to the termination date of such Letter of Credit), computed at a rate equal to the rate agreed by such Issuing Bank and the Parent (but in any event not to exceed 0.125% per annum) of the daily face
amount of such Letter of Credit, as well as such Issuing Bank’s reasonable and customary fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees
accrued to but excluding the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December shall be payable in arrears for the quarterly period then ended (or, in the case of the payment made on June 29, 2018, for the period from the Closing Date to such
date) on the last Business Day of such calendar quarter; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Class terminate, and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving
99
Credit Commitments of the applicable Class terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 30 days after receipt of a written demand (accompanied by reasonable back-up
documentation) therefor.
(c)

[Reserved].

(d)

The Parent agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon by the Parent and the Administrative Agent in writing.

(e)
All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees and participation fees, to the Revolving Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances except as otherwise provided in the Fee Letter. Fees payable hereunder shall accrue through and including the last day of the month
immediately preceding the applicable fee payment date.
(f)
(i) In the event that, on or prior to the date that is six months after the Closing Date (the “Initial Term Loan Soft Call Termination Date”), VPI (x) prepays, repays, refinances, substitutes or replaces any Initial Term Loans in
connection with a Repricing Transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.11(b)(iii) that constitutes a Repricing Transaction) or (y) effects any amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent under, this
Agreement resulting in a Repricing Transaction with respect to the Initial Term Loans, VPI shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the applicable Initial Term Lenders, (I) in the case of clause (x), a premium of 1.00% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Initial Term Loans so prepaid, repaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced and (II) in the case of clause (y), a fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Term Loans that are the subject of such
Repricing Transaction outstanding immediately prior to such amendment. If, on or prior to the Initial Term Loan Soft Call Termination Date, all or any portion of the Initial Term Loans held by any Term Lender are prepaid, repaid, refinanced, substituted or
replaced pursuant to Section 2.19(b)(iv) as a result of, or in connection with, such Term Lender not agreeing or otherwise consenting to any waiver, consent, modification or amendment referred to in clause (y) above (or otherwise in connection with a
Repricing Transaction), such prepayment, repayment, refinancing, substitution or replacement will be made at 101% of the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced. All such amounts shall be due and payable on the date of
effectiveness of such Repricing Transaction.
(ii) In the event that, on or prior to the date that is twelve months after the First Incremental Amendment Date (the “First Incremental Term Loan Soft Call Termination Date”), VPI (x) prepays, repays, refinances, substitutes or replaces any First
Incremental Term Loans in connection with a Repricing Transaction with respect to First Incremental Term Loans (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.11(b)(iii) that constitutes such a Repricing Transaction) or
(y) effects any amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent under, this Agreement resulting in a Repricing Transaction with respect to the First Incremental Term Loans, VPI shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the
applicable First Incremental Term Lenders, (I) in the case of clause (x), a premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the First Incremental Term Loans so prepaid, repaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced and (II) in the case of clause (y), a fee
equal to 1.00% of the
100
aggregate principal amount of the First Incremental Term Loans that are the subject of such Repricing Transaction outstanding immediately prior to such amendment. If, on or prior to the First Incremental Term Loan Soft Call Termination Date, all or any
portion of the First Incremental Term Loans held by any Term Lender are prepaid, repaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced pursuant to Section 2.19(b)(iv) as a result of, or in connection with, such Term Lender not agreeing or otherwise consenting to any
waiver, consent, modification or amendment referred to in clause (y) above (or otherwise in connection with a Repricing Transaction with respect to First Incremental Term Loans), such prepayment, repayment, refinancing, substitution or replacement will be
made at 101% of the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, refinanced, substituted or replaced. All such amounts shall be due and payable on the date of effectiveness of such Repricing Transaction.
(g)
Unless otherwise indicated herein, all computations of fees shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and shall be payable for the actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Each determination by the
Administrative Agent of the amount of any fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
Section 2.13.

Interest.

(a)

The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including Swingline Loans) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

(b)

The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at the Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

(c)
The Loans comprising (i) each Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Rate and (ii) each BA Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at the BA Rate for the Interest Period in
effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
(d)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the existence and continuance of any Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any LC Disbursement or any fee payable by a Borrower hereunder is
not, in each case, paid or reimbursed when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, the relevant overdue amount shall bear interest, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, after as well as before judgment, at
a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal or interest of any Loan or unreimbursed LC Disbursement, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan or LC Disbursement as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or
Section 2.05(h) or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% plus the rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section; provided that no amount shall be payable pursuant to this Section 2.13(d) to any
Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender; provided further that no amounts shall accrue pursuant to this Section 2.13(d) on any overdue amount, reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement or other amount payable to
a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender.
(e)
Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and on the Maturity Date applicable to such Loan or, in the case of any Revolving Loan, upon the termination of the Revolving
Credit Commitments of the applicable Class, as applicable; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a
101
prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan or Canadian Prime Rate Revolving Loan prior to the termination of the relevant revolving Commitments), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or
prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or BA Rate Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. Accrued
interest for any Class of Additional Loans shall be payable as set forth in the applicable Refinancing Amendment, Incremental Facility Amendment or Extension Amendment.
(f)
All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed for ABR Loans based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and
interest computed for Canadian Prime Rate Revolving Loans and BA Rate Revolving Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days, and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding
the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Eurocurrency Rate, Canadian Prime Rate or BA Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Interest shall accrue on each Loan
from the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.
Section 2.14.
(a)

Alternate Rate of Interest. If at least two Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or for a BA Rate Borrowing:

the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate or the BA Rate, as applicable, for such

Interest Period; or
(b)
the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Eurocurrency Rate or the BA Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining
their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
in each case in circumstances to which Section 2.24 does not apply, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Parent and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative
Agent notifies the Parent and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, which the Administrative Agent agrees promptly to do, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or a BA Rate Borrowing, as applicable, shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing or a Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing, as applicable (or, in the case
of a pending request for conversion or continuation of a Borrowing denominated in an Alternate Currency other than Canadian Dollars, the Parent, the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Lenders shall establish a mutually acceptable alternative rate) on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or a BA Rate Borrowing, as applicable, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing or a Canadian Prime Rate
Borrowing, as applicable (or, in the case of a pending request for a Borrowing denominated in an Alternate Currency other than Canadian Dollars, the
102
Parent, the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Lenders shall establish a mutually acceptable alternative rate).
Section 2.15.
(a)

Increased Costs.

If any Change in Law:

(i)
imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
reflected in the Eurocurrency Rate or the BA Rate) or Issuing Bank;
(ii)
subjects any Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and
(C) Connection Income Taxes) in respect of its loans, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii)
imposes on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans made by any Lender or any
Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the relevant Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or BA Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any Eurocurrency
Rate Loan, BA Rate Loan or Letter of Credit in an amount deemed by such Lender or Issuing Bank to be material, then, within 30 days after the Parent’s receipt of the certificate contemplated by paragraph (c) of this Section, the applicable Borrower will pay
to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that no Borrower shall be liable for such
compensation if (x) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto, (y) such Lender invokes Section 2.20 or (z) in the case of requests for reimbursement under clause (iii) above resulting from a market
disruption, (A) the relevant circumstances do not generally affect the banking market or (B) the applicable request has not been made by Lenders constituting Required Lenders.
(b)
If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding liquidity or capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of
such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which
such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law other than due to Taxes (taking into consideration such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such
Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s
103
holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then within 30 days of receipt by the Parent of the certificate contemplated by paragraph (c) of this Section the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)
Any Lender or Issuing Bank requesting compensation under this Section 2.15 shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Parent that (i) sets forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined and (iii) certifies that such Lender or Issuing Bank is generally charging such
amounts to similarly situated borrowers, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that no
Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank notifies the Parent of the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
Section 2.16.
Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the conversion or prepayment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or BA Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (whether
voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise), (b) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or BA Rate Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or
(c) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan or BA Rate Loan of any Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the applicable Parent pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the
applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense incurred by such Lender that is attributable to such event (other than loss of profit). In the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or BA Rate Loan, the loss, cost or expense of any
Lender shall be the amount reasonably determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Eurocurrency Rate or BA Rate that
would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period
for such Loan) over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a
comparable amount and period from other banks in the Eurodollar or applicable interbank market; it being understood that such loss, cost or expense shall in any case exclude any interest rate floor and all administrative, processing or similar fees. Any
Lender requesting compensation under this Section 2.16 shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Parent (i) setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, the basis therefor and, in
104
reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined and (ii) certifying that such Lender is generally charging the relevant amounts to similarly situated borrowers, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.
Section 2.17.

Taxes.

(a)
Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by
applicable Requirements of Law. If any applicable Requirement of Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by any applicable withholding agent, then (i) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the amount payable by the
applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) having been made by the applicable withholding agent, each Lender and each Issuing
Bank (as applicable) (or, where the Administrative Agent receives a payment for its own account, the Administrative Agent), receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the applicable withholding
agent shall make such deductions and (iii) such withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law.
(b)

In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law.

(c)
Each Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank within 30 days after receipt of the certificate described in the succeeding sentence, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes payable
or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section), as applicable, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto; provided that if such Loan Party reasonably believes that such Taxes were not correctly or legally asserted, the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with such Loan Party to
obtain a refund of such Taxes (which shall be repaid to such Loan Party in accordance with Section 2.17(g)) so long as such efforts would not, in the sole determination of the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank, result in any additional outof-pocket costs or expenses not reimbursed by such Loan Party or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable. In connection with any request for reimbursement under this
Section 2.17(c), the relevant Lender, Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall deliver a certificate to the Parent setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis and calculation of the amount of the relevant payment or liability.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.17(c), no Borrower shall be required to indemnify the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.17(c) for any incremental interest or penalties
resulting from a failure of such Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, to notify the Parent of the relevant possible indemnification claim within 180 days after the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank receives
written notice from the applicable taxing authority of the specific tax assessment giving rise to such indemnification claim.
(d)

[reserved]
105

(e)
As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such
Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(f)

Status of Lenders and Issuing Banks.

(i)
Any Lender and any Issuing Bank that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Parent and the Administrative
Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Parent or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation as the Parent or the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to permit such payments to
be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender and any Issuing Bank, if reasonably requested by the Parent or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by
applicable Requirements of Law or reasonably requested by the Parent or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Parent or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender or Issuing Bank is subject to backup
withholding or information reporting requirements. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Parent and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.17(f).
(ii)
Each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees that if any documentation it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such documentation or promptly notify the Parent
and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal ineligibility to do so.
(iii)

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

(A)
any Lender or Issuing Bank that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a “U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank”) shall deliver to the Parent and the Administrative
Agent on or about the date on which such U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank becomes a Lender or the Issuing Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Parent or the
Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)
any Lender that is not a U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank (a “Non-U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank”) shall, to the extent it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to the Parent and the Administrative Agent (in such
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank becomes a Lender or Issuing Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter
106
upon the reasonable request of the Parent or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(1)
in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any
Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such
tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal
withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
(2)

executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;

(3)
in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form
of Exhibit L-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the applicable U.S. Borrower within the
meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” related to the applicable U.S. Borrower as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and no payments in
connection with the Agreement are effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of
IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or
(4)
to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS
Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-2 or Exhibit L-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as
applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank are
claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender/Issuing Bank may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-4 on behalf of each such direct and
indirect partner;
(C)
any Lender or Issuing Bank shall, to the extent it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to the Parent and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or
about the date on which such Lender or Issuing Bank becomes a Lender or Issuing Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Parent or the Administrative Agent),
executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Requirements
107
of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law to
permit the Parent or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D)
if a payment made to a Lender or Issuing Bank under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender or Issuing Bank were to fail to comply
with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or Issuing Bank shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and the
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable
Requirements of Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be
necessary for the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether such Lender or Issuing Bank has complied with such Lender’s or Issuing
Bank’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the
date of this Agreement.
(iv)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a Lender or Issuing Bank shall not be required to deliver any documentation under this Section 2.17(e) to the extent it is legally ineligible to deliver.

(g)
If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes (whether received in cash or applied by the taxing authority granting the refund to offset other Taxes
otherwise owed) as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of
indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such indemnifying party under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such
refund) of such indemnified party, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that such indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, agrees to repay to
such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event the indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) to the extent that the payment thereof
would place the indemnified party in a less
108
favorable net after-Tax position than the position that the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise
to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other
Person.
(h)
Minimum Interest. As part of entering into this Agreement, the parties hereto have assumed that the interest payable at the rates set forth in this Agreement is not and will not become subject to Swiss Federal Withholding Tax.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that in the event that (A) Swiss Federal Withholding Tax is due on interest payments or other payments by any Loan Party under this Agreement and (B) Section 2.17(a) is unenforceable for any reason,
where payment of an additional amount would otherwise be required by the terms of Section 2.17(a):
(x)
the applicable interest rate in relation to that interest payment shall be (i) the interest rate which would have applied to that interest payment divided by (ii) 1 minus the rate at which the relevant Swiss Federal Withholding
Tax deduction is required to be made under Swiss domestic tax law and/or applicable double taxation treaties (where the rate at which the relevant Swiss Federal Withholding Tax deduction is required to be made is for this
purpose expressed as a fraction of 1); and
(y)
the Loan Party shall (i) pay the relevant interest at the adjusted rate in accordance with paragraph (x) above, (ii) make the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax deduction on the interest so recalculated and (iii) all references to
a rate of interest under the Agreement shall be construed accordingly.
To the extent that interest payable by any Loan Party under this Agreement becomes subject to Swiss Federal Withholding Tax, the parties shall promptly cooperate in completing any procedural formalities (including
submitting forms and documents required by the Swiss or foreign tax authorities) to the extent possible and necessary (i) for the Loan Party to obtain the authorization from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration to make interest
payments without them being subject to Swiss Federal Withholding Tax or being subject to Swiss Federal Withholding Tax at a reduced rate under applicable double taxation treaties and (ii) to ensure that any person entitled to
a full or partial refund under any applicable double taxation treaty is so refunded.
Section 2.17(g) equally applies to this Section 2.17(h).
(i)
Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, any Lender or Issuing Bank, the termination of the
Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
(j)

For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term “Requirements of Law” includes FATCA.
109

Section 2.18.

Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Sharing of Payments.

(a)
Unless otherwise specified, each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or
2.17 or otherwise) prior to the time expressed hereunder or under such Loan Document (or, if no time is expressly required, by 2:00 p.m.) on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.17) or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall
be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated to the Parent by the Administrative Agent, except payments to be made directly to the applicable Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that
payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender’s portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round such Lender’s percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher
or lower whole dollar amount. Except as set forth in any amendment entered into pursuant to Section 10.02(b)(ii)(E) with respect to the making of Revolving Loans or Letters of Credit denominated in a currency other than Dollars, all payments (including
accrued interest) hereunder shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the
necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
(b)
Subject in all respects to the provisions of any applicable Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent at any time when an Event of Default exists and all or any portion of the
Loans have been accelerated hereunder pursuant to Section 8.01, shall, upon election by the Administrative Agent or at the direction of the Required Lenders, be applied, first, on a pro rata basis, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements then
due to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank from the Borrowers constituting Loan Document Obligations, second, on a pro rata basis, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Borrowers constituting Loan
Document Obligations, third, to pay interest due and payable in respect of any Loans, on a pro rata basis, fourth, to prepay principal on the Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements, all Banking Services Obligations and all Secured Hedging Obligations on
a pro rata basis among the Secured Parties, fifth, to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent equal to 100% of the LC Exposure (minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account) on such date, to be held in the LC Collateral Account as Cash
collateral for such Loan Document Obligations, on a pro rata basis; provided that if any Letter of Credit expires undrawn, then any Cash collateral held to secure the related LC Exposure shall be applied in accordance with this Section 2.18(b), beginning with
clause first above, sixth, to the payment of any other Secured Obligation due to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Secured Party by the Borrowers on a pro rata basis, seventh, as provided for under any applicable Acceptable Intercreditor
Agreement and eighth, to the Parent or as the Parent shall direct.
(c)
If any Lender obtains payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans of any Class or participations in LC Disbursements
or Swingline Loans held by it resulting in such
110
Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender with Loans of
such Class and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for Cash at face value) participations in the Loans and sub-participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans of
other Lenders of such Class at such time outstanding to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their
respective Loans of such Class and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded
and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to (x) any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any
payment obtained by any Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any permitted assignee or participant, including any payment made or deemed made in connection with Sections 2.22, 2.23, 10.02(c)
and/or Section 10.05. Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Requirements of Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against
the applicable Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be
conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.18(c) and will, in each case, notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this
Section 2.18(c) shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Loan Document Obligations purchased to the same extent as
though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Loan Document Obligations purchased.
(d)
Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender or any Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will
not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank the amount due.
In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate (or, with respect to any such amounts denominated
in an Alternate Currency, the Administrative Agent’s customary rate for interbank advances in such Alternate Currency) and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e)
If any Lender fails to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or Section 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
111
Section 2.19.

Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

(a)
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or such Lender determines it can no longer make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.20, or any Loan Party is required to pay any
additional amount to or indemnify any Lender, Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender or Issuing Bank shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or its participation in any Letter of Credit affected by such event, or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender or Issuing Bank, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as applicable, in the future or mitigate the impact of Section 2.20, as the case may be, and (ii) would not subject such
Lender or Issuing Bank to any material unreimbursed out-of-pocket cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or Issuing Bank in any material respect. Each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by any Lender or Issuing Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)
If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or such Lender determines it can no longer make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.20, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any
additional amount to or indemnify any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring
the consent of “each Lender”, “each Revolving Lender” or “each Lender directly affected thereby” (or any other Class or group of Lenders other than the Required Lenders) with respect to which Required Lender or Required Revolving Lender consent (or
the consent of Lenders holding loans or commitments of such Class or lesser group representing more than 50% of the sum of the total loans and unused commitments of such Class or lesser group at such time) has been obtained, as applicable, any Lender is
a non-consenting Lender (each such Lender, a “Non-Consenting Lender”), then the Parent may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (x) terminate the applicable Commitments and/or Additional
Commitments of such Lender, and procure the repayment of all Loan Document Obligations of the applicable Borrowers owing to such Lender relating to the applicable Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date under one or
more Credit Facilities or Additional Credit Facilities as the Parent may elect or (y) replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to assign and delegate (and such Lender shall be obligated to assign and delegate), without recourse (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.05), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if any Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (A) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of its Loans and, if applicable, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, in each case of such Class of Loans,
Commitments and/or Additional Commitments, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder with respect to such Class of Loans, Commitments and/or Additional Commitments, (B) in the case of any assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (C) such assignment does not conflict with applicable
law. No action by or consent of a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender shall be necessary in connection with such assignment, which shall be immediately and automatically effective upon payment of the amounts described in clause (A) of the
immediately preceding sentence. No Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) shall be required to
112
make any such assignment and delegation, and the applicable Borrowers may not repay the Loan Document Obligations of such Lender and the Parent may not terminate its Commitments or Additional Commitments, if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver
by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Parent to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that if it is replaced pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Promissory Note (if the assigning Lender’s Loans are evidenced by one or more Promissory Notes) subject to such Assignment and
Assumption (provided that the failure of any Lender replaced pursuant to this Section 2.19 to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver any such Promissory Note shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid),
such assignment shall be recorded in the Register and any such Promissory Note shall be deemed cancelled. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Lender’s attorney-infact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Lender and in the name of such Lender, from time to time in the Administrative Agent’s discretion, with prior written notice to such Lender, to take any action and to execute any such Assignment and
Assumption or other instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this clause (b). To the extent that any Lender is replaced pursuant to Section 2.19(b)(iv) in connection with a Repricing Transaction
requiring payment of a fee pursuant to Section 2.12(f), VPI shall pay to each Lender being replaced as a result of such Repricing Transaction the fee set forth in Section 2.12(f).
Section 2.20.
Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable
lending office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate or BA Rate (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternate Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency
Rate or the BA Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or an Alternate Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by
such Lender to the Parent through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to (A) make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans in Dollars or such Alternate Currency, (B) in the case of Dollars, to convert ABR Loans to
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (C) in the case of Canadian Dollars, to convert Canadian Prime Rate Loans to BA Rate Loans, shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans denominated in
Dollars the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender, shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the
Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Parent that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist
(which notice such Lender agrees to give promptly). Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the applicable Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or (A) if applicable and such Loans are denominated in
Dollars, convert all of such Lender’s Eurocurrency Rate Loans to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency
Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate), (B) if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Canadian Dollars, convert all of such Lender’s BA Rate Loans to Canadian Prime Rate Loans
113
or (C) if applicable and such Loans are denominated in an Alternate Currency other than Canadian Dollars, convert such Loans to Loans bearing interest at an alternative rate that is mutually acceptable to the applicable Borrowers and such Lender, in each
case, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans, as applicable, to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain
such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or BA Rate Loans, as applicable (in which case the applicable Borrowers shall not be required to make payments pursuant to Section 2.16 in connection with such payment) and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such
Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate
component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the
applicable Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the determination of such Lender,
otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
Section 2.21.

Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:

(a)
Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of any Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and, subject to clause (d)(iv) below, on the participation of such Defaulting Lender in Letters of Credit
pursuant to Section 2.12(b) and pursuant to any other provisions of this Agreement or other Loan Document.
(b)
The Commitments, Loans and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders, each affected Lender, the Required Lenders, the Required Revolving Lenders or such other number of
Lenders as may be required hereby or under any other Loan Document have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any waiver, amendment or modification pursuant to Section 10.02); provided that any waiver, amendment or
modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender disproportionately and adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
(c)
Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 2.11, Section 2.15,
Section 2.16, Section 2.17, Section 2.18, Article 8, Section 10.05 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.09), shall be applied at such time or times as may be
determined by the Administrative Agent and, where relevant, the Parent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts
owing by such Defaulting Lender to any applicable Issuing Bank and/or Swingline Lender hereunder; third, if so reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or reasonably requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, to be held as Cash collateral for
future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender in respect of any participation in any Letter of Credit; fourth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, as the Parent may
114
request, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or the Parent, to be held in a deposit account and released
in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the non-Defaulting Lenders, Issuing Banks or Swingline Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by any non-Defaulting Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, to the payment of any amounts
owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such
Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Exposure in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its
appropriate share and (y) such Loan or LC Exposure was made or created, as applicable, at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Exposure owed to, all
non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Exposure owed to, such Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to any Defaulting Lender that are applied (or
held) to pay amounts owed by any Defaulting Lender or to post Cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.21(c) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(d)

If any Swingline Loans or LC Exposure exists at the time any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:

(i)
all or any part of such Swingline Loans and LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent the sum of
all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders’ Revolving Credit Commitments; provided that no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any
claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from such Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure
following such reallocation;
(ii)
if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the applicable Borrower shall, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable
Requirements of Law, within two Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent, Cash collateralize 100% of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure and any obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund participations in any
Swingline Loan (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to paragraph (i) above and any Cash collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender or pursuant to Section 2.21(c) above) or make other arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and to the applicable Issuing Bank and/or Swingline Lender with respect to such LC Exposure and/or Swingline Loans and obligations to fund participations. Cash collateral (or the appropriate
portion thereof) provided to reduce LC Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (A) the elimination of the applicable LC Exposure or other obligations giving
115
rise thereto (including by the termination of the Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 2.19)) or (B) the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that
there exists excess Cash collateral (including as a result of any subsequent reallocation of Swingline Loans and LC Exposure among non-Defaulting Lenders described in clause (i) above);
(iii)
(A) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.21(d), then the fees payable to the Revolving Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and (b), as the case may be, shall be
adjusted to give effect to such reallocation and (B) if the LC Exposure of any Defaulting Lender is Cash collateralized pursuant to this Section 2.21(d), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Issuing Bank, any
Lender or the Borrowers hereunder, no letter of credit fees shall be payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure; and
(iv) if any Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is not Cash collateralized, prepaid or reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.21(d), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Issuing Bank or any
Revolving Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is Cash
collateralized or reallocated.
(e)
So long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan, and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, create, incur, amend or increase any Letter of
Credit unless it is reasonably satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders, Cash collateral provided pursuant to Section 2.21(c) and/or Cash collateral provided by the
applicable Borrower in accordance with Section 2.21(d), and participating interests in any such or newly issued, extended or created Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders in a manner
consistent with Section 2.21(d)(i) (it being understood that Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).
(f)
In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Parent agree that any Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Applicable Percentage of Swingline Loans
and LC Exposure of the Revolving Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment, and on such date such Revolving Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Revolving
Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) or participations in Revolving Loans as the Administrative Agent shall determine as are necessary in order for such Revolving Lender to hold such Revolving Loans or participations in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage of the applicable Class. Notwithstanding the fact that any Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, (x) no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or
payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender and (y) except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or
release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
116
Section 2.22.

Incremental Credit Extensions.

(a)
One or more Borrowers (or Subsidiary Guarantors that will become Borrowers) may, at any time, on one or more occasions pursuant to an Incremental Facility Amendment (i) add one or more new Classes of term facilities and/or
increase the principal amount of the Term Loans of any existing Class by requesting new term loan commitments to be added to such Loans (any such new Class or increase, an “Incremental Term Facility” and any loans made pursuant to an Incremental
Term Facility, “Incremental Term Loans”) and/or (ii) add one or more new Classes of revolving commitments and/or increase the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any existing Class (any such new Class or increase, an
“Incremental Revolving Facility” and, together with any Incremental Term Facility, “Incremental Facilities”, or either or any thereof, an “Incremental Facility”; and the loans thereunder, “Incremental Revolving Loans” and, together with any
Incremental Term Loans, “Incremental Loans”) in an aggregate outstanding principal amount not to exceed the Incremental Cap; provided that:
(i)

no Incremental Commitment in respect of any Incremental Term Facility may be in an amount that is less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount to which the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree),

(ii)
except as separately agreed from time to time between a Borrower and any Lender, no Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental Commitment, and the determination to provide such commitments shall be
within the sole and absolute discretion of such Lender (it being agreed that no Borrower shall be obligated to offer the opportunity to any Lender to participate in any Incremental Facility),
(iii)
no Incremental Facility or Incremental Loan (nor the creation, provision or implementation thereof) shall require the approval of any existing Lender other than in its capacity, if any, as a lender providing all or part
of such Incremental Facility or Incremental Loan,
(iv) any such Incremental Revolving Facility shall either (A) be subject to the same terms and conditions as any then-existing Revolving Facility (and be deemed added to, and made a part of, such Revolving Facility) (it
being understood that, if required to consummate an Incremental Revolving Facility, the Parent may increase the pricing, interest rate margins, rate floors and undrawn fees on the applicable Revolving Facility being increased for all lenders
under such Revolving Facility, but additional upfront or similar fees may be payable to the lenders participating in such Incremental Revolving Facility without any requirement to pay such amounts to any existing Revolving Lenders) or
(B) mature no earlier than, and require no scheduled mandatory commitment reduction prior to, the Initial Revolving Credit Maturity Date and all other material terms (other than pricing, maturity, upfront, arrangement, structuring,
underwriting, ticking, consent, amendment and other fees, participation in mandatory prepayments or commitment reductions and immaterial terms, which shall be determined by the Parent) shall be substantially consistent with the Initial
Revolving Loans or shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (it being understood that if any financial maintenance covenant or other more favorable provision is added for the benefit of any Incremental Revolving
Facility, no consent shall be required from the Administrative Agent or any Lender to the extent that such financial maintenance covenant or other
117
provision is (1) also added for the benefit of any then-existing Revolving Facility or (2) only applicable after the applicable Latest Revolving Loan Maturity Date),
(v)
the Effective Yield (and the components thereof) applicable to any Incremental Facility may be determined by the Parent and the lender or lenders providing such Incremental Facility; provided that, in the case of any
broadly syndicated Dollar-denominated Incremental Term Facility, the Effective Yield applicable thereto may not be more than 0.50% higher than the Effective Yield applicable to the Initial Term Loans or the First Incremental Term Loans
(each as applicable) unless the Applicable Rate (and/or, as provided in the proviso below, the Alternate Base Rate floor or Eurocurrency Rate floor) with respect to the Initial Term Loans and/or the First Incremental Term Loans, as
applicable, is adjusted such that the Effective Yield on the Initial Term Loans and the First Incremental Term Loans (each, as applicable) is not more than 0.50% per annum less than the Effective Yield with respect to such Incremental
Facility (this proviso, the “MFN Provision”); provided further that any increase in Effective Yield applicable to any Initial Term Loan and/or First Incremental Term Loan (as applicable) due to the application or imposition of an Alternate
Base Rate floor or Eurocurrency Rate floor on any Incremental Term Loan may, at the election of the Parent, be effected through an increase in (or implementation of, as applicable) any Alternate Base Rate floor or Eurocurrency Rate floor
applicable to such Initial Term Loans or First Incremental Term Loans, as applicable, or an increase in the interest rate margin applicable to such Incremental Loans; provided further that the MFN Provision shall not apply to (1) Incremental
Term Facilities having an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $750,000,000 (as selected by the Parent), (2) Incremental Term Facilities scheduled to mature on or after the date that is one year after the Initial Term Loan Maturity Date
or (3) Incremental Term Facilities incurred more than 12 months after the Closing Date,
(vi) subject to the Permitted Earlier Maturity Indebtedness Exception, the final maturity date with respect to any Incremental Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Initial Term Loan Maturity Date at the time of the
incurrence thereof; provided, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to customary bridge loans with a maturity date not longer than one year; provided, that any loans, notes, securities or other Indebtedness which are exchanged for or
otherwise replace such bridge loans shall be subject to the requirements of this clause (vi),
(vii)
subject to the Permitted Earlier Maturity Indebtedness Exception, the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Incremental Term Facility shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity
of the Initial Term Loans; provided, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to customary bridge loans with a maturity date of not longer than one year; provided, that any loans, notes, securities or other Indebtedness which are
exchanged for or otherwise replace such bridge loans shall be subject to the requirements of this clause (vii),
(viii)

subject to clauses (vi) and (vii) above, any Incremental Term Facility may otherwise have an amortization schedule as determined by the Parent and the lenders providing such Incremental Term Facility,
118

(ix)

subject to clause (v) above, to the extent applicable, any fees payable in connection with any Incremental Facility shall be determined by the Parent and the arrangers and/or lenders providing such Incremental

Facility,
(x)
(A) each Incremental Facility shall rank pari passu with the Initial Term Loans (in the case of any Incremental Term Facility) and pari passu with the Initial Revolving Loans (in the case of Incremental Revolving
Loans), in each case in right of payment and security and (B) no Incremental Facility may be (x) guaranteed by any Person which is not a Loan Party or (y) secured by Liens on any assets other than the Collateral,
(xi) any Incremental Term Facility may provide for the ability to participate (A) on a pro rata basis or non-pro rata basis in any voluntary prepayment of Term Loans made pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and (B) on a pro rata
or less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis, other than in the case of prepayment with proceeds of Indebtedness refinancing such Incremental Term Loans) in any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans required
pursuant to Section 2.11(b),
(xii)
no Specified Event of Default shall exist immediately prior to or after giving effect to the effectiveness of such Incremental Facility (except in connection with any acquisition or other Investment or irrevocable
repayment or redemption of Indebtedness, where no such Specified Event of Default shall exist at the time as elected by the Parent pursuant to Section 1.04(e)),
(xiii)

except as otherwise required or permitted in clauses (iv) through (xi) above, all other terms of any Incremental Term Facility shall be as agreed between the Parent and the lenders providing such Incremental Term

Facility,
(xiv) the proceeds of any Incremental Facility may be used for working capital, Capital Expenditures and other general corporate purposes of the applicable Borrowers and their subsidiaries (including permitted
Restricted Payments, Investments, Permitted Acquisitions, Restricted Debt Payments and any other purpose not prohibited by the terms of the Loan Documents), and
(xv)
on the date of the making of any Incremental Term Loans that will be added to any Class of then existing Term Loans, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Sections 2.08 or 2.13, such Incremental
Term Loans shall be added to (and constitute a part of, be of the same Type as and, at the election of the Parent, have the same Interest Period as) each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of such Class on a pro rata basis (based on the
relative sizes of such Borrowings), so that each Term Lender providing such Incremental Term Loans will participate proportionately in each then-outstanding Borrowing of Term Loans of such Class; it being acknowledged that the
application of this clause may result in new Incremental Term Loans having Interest Periods (the duration of which may be less than one month) that begin during an Interest Period then applicable to outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans or
BA Rate Loans of the relevant Class and which end on the last day of such Interest Period.
119
(b)
Incremental Commitments may be provided by any existing Lender or by any other Eligible Assignee (any such other Eligible Assignee being called an “Additional Lender”); provided that the Administrative Agent (and, in the case
of any Incremental Revolving Facility, the Swingline Lender and any Issuing Bank) shall have consented (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the relevant Additional Lender’s provision of Incremental Commitments if
such consent would be required under Section 10.05(b) for an assignment of Loans to such Additional Lender; provided further, that any Additional Lender that is an Affiliated Lender shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.05(g), mutatis mutandis,
to the same extent as if the relevant Incremental Commitments and related Loan Document Obligations had been obtained by such Lender by way of assignment.
(c)
Each Lender or Additional Lender providing a portion of any Incremental Commitment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Parent all such documentation (including the relevant Incremental Facility
Amendment) as may be reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to evidence and effectuate such Incremental Commitment. On the effective date of such Incremental Commitment, each Additional Lender shall become a Lender for all purposes in
connection with this Agreement.
(d)
As a condition precedent to the effectiveness of any Incremental Facility or the making of any Incremental Loans, (i) upon its request, the Administrative Agent shall have received customary written opinions of counsel, as well as
such reaffirmation agreements, supplements and/or amendments as it shall reasonably require, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received, from each Additional Lender, an administrative questionnaire in the form provided to such Additional Lender by
the Administrative Agent (the “Administrative Questionnaire”) and such other documents as it shall reasonably require from such Additional Lender, (iii) the Administrative Agent and applicable Additional Lenders shall have received all fees required to
be paid in respect of such Incremental Facility or Incremental Loans and (iv) upon its request, the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of Parent signed by a Responsible Officer thereof:

(e)

(A)

certifying and attaching a copy of the resolutions adopted by the governing body of the applicable Borrowers approving or consenting to such Incremental Facility or Incremental Loans, and

(B)

to the extent applicable, certifying that the condition set forth in clause (a)(xii) above has been satisfied.

Upon the implementation of any Incremental Revolving Facility pursuant to this Section 2.22:

(i)
if such Incremental Revolving Facility establishes Revolving Credit Commitments of the same Class as any then-existing Class of Revolving Credit Commitments, (i) each Revolving Lender immediately prior to such
increase will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assigned to each relevant Incremental Revolving Facility Lender, and each relevant Incremental Revolving Facility Lender will automatically and without further act be
deemed to have assumed a portion of such Revolving Lender’s participations hereunder in outstanding Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans such that, after giving effect to each deemed assignment and assumption of participations, all of
the Revolving Lenders’ (including each Incremental Revolving
120
Facility Lender’s) (A) participations hereunder in Letters of Credit and (B) participations hereunder in Swingline Loans shall be held on a pro rata basis on the basis of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments (after giving effect to
any increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.22) and (ii) the existing Revolving Lenders of the applicable Class shall assign Revolving Loans to certain other Revolving Lenders of such Class (including the
Revolving Lenders providing the relevant Incremental Revolving Facility), and such other Revolving Lenders (including the Revolving Lenders providing the relevant Incremental Revolving Facility) shall purchase such Revolving Loans,
in each case to the extent necessary so that all of the Revolving Lenders of such Class participate in each outstanding borrowing of Revolving Loans pro rata on the basis of their respective Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class
(after giving effect to any increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.22); it being understood and agreed that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained
elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to this clause (i); and
(ii)
if such Incremental Revolving Facility establishes Revolving Credit Commitments of a new Class, (1) the borrowing and repayment (except for (A) payments of interest and fees at different rates on any Revolving
Facility, (B) repayments required upon the Maturity Date of any Revolving Facility and (C) repayments made in connection with any permanent repayment and termination of any Revolving Credit Commitments (subject to clause
(3) below)) of Incremental Revolving Loans after the effective date of such Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments shall be made on a pro rata basis with any then-existing Revolving Facility, (2) all swingline loans and/or letters of
credit made or issued, as applicable, under such Incremental Revolving Facility shall be participated on a pro rata basis by all Revolving Lenders and (3) any permanent repayment of Revolving Loans with respect to, and reduction or
termination of Revolving Credit Commitments under, any Revolving Facility after the effective date of any Incremental Revolving Facility shall be made on a pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis with all other Revolving Facilities,
except that the applicable Borrowers shall be permitted to permanently repay Revolving Loans and terminate Revolving Credit Commitments of any Revolving Facility on a greater than pro rata basis (I) as compared to any other Revolving
Facilities with a later Maturity Date than such Revolving Facility or (II) to the extent refinanced or replaced with a Replacement Revolving Facility or Replacement Debt.
(f)
On the date of effectiveness of any Incremental Revolving Facility, the maximum amount of LC Exposure and/or Swingline Loans, as applicable, permitted hereunder shall increase by an amount, if any, agreed upon by the
Administrative Agent, the Parent and the relevant Issuing Bank and/or the Swingline Lender, as applicable.
(g)
The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any Incremental Facility Amendment and/or any amendment to any other Loan Document with the Parent and/or the applicable Borrowers as may be
necessary in order to establish new or any increase in any Classes or sub-Classes in respect of Loans or commitments pursuant to this Section 2.22 and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the
Administrative Agent and the Parent in connection with the establishment or increase, as applicable,
121
of such Classes or sub-Classes, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.22 (including with respect to the appointment of a Subsidiary Guarantor as a Borrower in respect of such Incremental Facility).
(h)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.22 (including Section 2.22(d)) or in any other provision of any Loan Document, if the proceeds of any Incremental Facility are intended to be applied to finance an acquisition
or other Investment and the lenders providing such Incremental Facility so agree, the availability thereof shall be subject to customary “SunGard” or “certain funds” conditionality (including the making and accuracy of customary specified representations in
connection with such acquisition or other Investment).
(i)

This Section 2.22 shall supersede any provision in Section 2.18 or 10.02 to the contrary.

Section 2.23.

Extensions of Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments.

(a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, pursuant to one or more offers (each, an “Extension Offer”) made from time to time by the Parent to all Lenders holding Loans of any Class or Commitments of any Class,
in each case on a pro rata basis (based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the respective Loans or Commitments of such Class) and on the same terms to each such Lender, the Parent and/or the applicable Borrowers are hereby permitted from
time to time to consummate transactions with any individual Lender who accepts the terms contained in the relevant Extension Offer to extend the Maturity Date of all or a portion of such Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments of such Class and otherwise
modify the terms of all or a portion of such Loans and/or Commitments pursuant to the terms of the relevant Extension Offer (including by increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Loans and/or Commitments (and related outstandings)
and/or modifying the amortization schedule, if any, in respect of such Loans) (each, an “Extension”); it being understood that any Extended Term Loans shall constitute a separate Class of Loans from the Class of Loans from which they were converted and
any Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall constitute a separate Class of Revolving Credit Commitments from the Class of Revolving Credit Commitments from which they were converted, so long as the following terms are satisfied:
(i)
except as to (x) interest rates, fees and final maturity (which shall, subject to clause (iii)(y) below, be determined by the Parent and set forth in the relevant Extension Offer), (y) terms applicable to such Extended
Revolving Credit Commitments or Extended Revolving Loans that are more favorable to the lenders or the agent of such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or Extended Revolving Loans than those contained in the Loan Documents
and are then conformed (or added) to the Loan Documents on or prior to the effectiveness of such Extension for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders or, as applicable, the Administrative Agent pursuant to the applicable Extension
Amendment and (z) any terms or other provisions applicable only to periods after the Latest Revolving Loan Maturity Date (in each case, as of the date of such Extension), the commitment of any Revolving Lender that agrees to an
Extension (an “Extended Revolving Credit Commitment”; and the Loans thereunder, “Extended Revolving Loans”), and the related outstandings, shall be a revolving commitment (or related outstandings, as the case may be) with
substantially consistent terms (or terms not less favorable to existing Revolving Lenders) as the Class of Revolving Credit
122
Commitments subject to the relevant Extension Offer (and related outstandings) provided hereunder; provided that to the extent more than one Revolving Facility exists after giving effect to any such Extension, (1) the borrowing and
repayment (except for (A) payments of interest and fees at different rates on any Revolving Facility (and related outstandings), (B) repayments required upon the Maturity Date of any Revolving Facility and (C) repayments made in
connection with any permanent repayment and termination of any Revolving Credit Commitments (subject to clause (3) below)) of Extended Revolving Loans after the effective date of such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall
be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolving Facilities, (2) all swingline loans and/or letters of credit made or issued, as applicable, under any Extended Revolving Credit Commitment shall be participated on a pro rata basis by all
Revolving Lenders of the applicable Class and (3) any permanent repayment of Revolving Loans with respect to, and reduction or termination of Revolving Credit Commitments under, any Revolving Facility after the effective date of such
Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall be made on a pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis with all other Revolving Facilities, except that the applicable Borrowers shall be permitted to permanently repay Revolving Loans and
terminate Revolving Credit Commitments of any Revolving Facility on a greater than pro rata basis (I) as compared to any other Revolving Facilities with a later Maturity Date than such Revolving Facility or (II) to the extent refinanced or
replaced with a Replacement Revolving Facility or Replacement Debt;
(ii)
except as to (x) interest rates, fees, amortization, final maturity date, premiums, required prepayment dates and participation in prepayments (which shall, subject to immediately succeeding clauses (iii)(x), (iv) and
(v), be determined by the Parent and set forth in the relevant Extension Offer), (y) terms applicable to such Extended Term Loans that are more favorable to the lenders or the agent of such Extended Term Loans than those contained in the
Loan Documents and are then conformed (or added) to the Loan Documents on or prior to the effectiveness of such Extension for the benefit of the Term Lenders or, as applicable, the Administrative Agent pursuant to the applicable
Extension Amendment and (z) any terms or other provisions applicable only to periods after the Latest Term Loan Maturity Date (in each case, as of the date of such Extension), the Term Loans of any Lender extended pursuant to any
Extension (any such extended Term Loans, the “Extended Term Loans”) shall have substantially consistent terms (or terms not less favorable to existing Lenders) as the tranche of Term Loans subject to the relevant Extension Offer;
(iii)
(x) the final maturity date of any Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than the then applicable Latest Term Loan Maturity Date at the time of extension and (y) no Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or
Extended Revolving Loans shall have a final maturity date earlier than (or require commitment reductions prior to) the then applicable Latest Revolving Loan Maturity Date;
(iv)

the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any then-existing Term Loans;
123

(v)

subject to clauses (iii) and (iv) above, any Extended Term Loans may otherwise have an amortization schedule as determined by the Parent and the Lenders providing such Extended Term Loans;

(vi) any Extended Term Loans may provide for the ability to participate (A) on a pro rata basis or non-pro rata basis in any voluntary prepayment of Term Loans made pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and (B) on a pro rata or
less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis other than in the case of prepayment with proceeds of Indebtedness refinancing such Extended Term Loans) in any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans required pursuant to
Section 2.11(b);
(vii)
if the aggregate principal amount of Loans or commitments, as the case may be, in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Extension Offer exceeds the maximum aggregate principal amount of
Loans or commitments, as the case may be, offered to be extended by the Parent pursuant to such Extension Offer, then the Loans or commitments, as the case may be, of such Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount
based on the respective principal amounts (but not to exceed actual holdings of record) held by Lenders that have accepted such Extension Offer;
(viii)

unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, each Extension shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000;

(ix)

any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied or waived by the Parent; and

(x)

all documentation in respect of such Extension shall be consistent with the foregoing.

(b)
With respect to any Extension consummated pursuant to this Section 2.23, (i) no such Extension shall constitute a voluntary or mandatory prepayment for purposes of Section 2.11, (ii) the scheduled amortization payments (in so far
as such schedule affects payments due to Lenders participating in the relevant Class) set forth in Section 2.10 shall be adjusted to give effect to such Extension of the relevant Class and (iii) except as set forth in clause (a)(viii) above, no Extension Offer is
required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment; provided that the Parent may, at its election, specify as a condition (a “Minimum Extension Condition”) to consummating such Extension that a minimum amount (to be determined and
specified in the relevant Extension Offer in the Parent’s sole discretion and which may be waived by the Parent in its sole discretion) of Loans or commitments (as applicable) of any or all applicable Classes be tendered. The Administrative Agent and the
Lenders hereby consent to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.23 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any payment of any interest, fees or premium in respect of any tranche of Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Credit
Commitments on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Offer) and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including Sections 2.10, 2.11 or 2.18) or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any
Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section.
(c)
No consent of any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall be required to effectuate any Extension, other than (A) the consent of each Lender agreeing to such Extension with respect to one or more of its Loans and/or commitments
under any Class (or a portion thereof), (B) with respect
124
to any Extension of the Revolving Credit Commitments, the consent of each Issuing Bank to the extent the commitment to provide Letters of Credit is to be extended and (C) with respect to any Extension of the Revolving Credit Commitments, the consent of
the Swingline Lender to the extent the swingline facility is to be extended (in each case which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). All Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and all obligations in respect
thereof shall constitute Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by the Collateral and guaranteed on a pari passu basis with all other Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Lenders
hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any Extension Amendment and such other amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Parent and/or the applicable Borrowers as may be necessary in order to
establish new Classes or sub-Classes in respect of Loans or commitments so extended and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Parent in connection with the
establishment of such new Classes or sub-Classes, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.23.
(d)
In connection with any Extension, the Parent shall provide the Administrative Agent at least five Business Days’ (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to
such procedures (including regarding timing, rounding and other adjustments and to ensure reasonable administrative management of the credit facilities hereunder after such Extension), if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative
Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.23.
Section 2.24.
LIBOR Replacement. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances set forth in Section 2.14 have arisen and such
circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances set forth in Section 2.14 have not arisen but the supervisor for the administrator of the Eurocurrency Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has
made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Eurocurrency Rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative Agent and the Parent shall endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest to the
Eurocurrency Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate
of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable; provided that, if such alternate rate of interest shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 10.02, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five (5) Business Days of the date notice of such
alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.

limited or restricted by, or require any consent, authorization, approval or license under, any Requirement of Law, (C) on the Closing Date and until required pursuant to Section 5.12, as applicable, the pledge or creation of any security interest, or the effects
of perfection or non-perfection, the priority or enforceability of any pledge or security interest to the extent the same is not required on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 4.01 or (D) any Excluded Asset.

faith, with financially sound and reputable insurers, such insurance coverage with respect to liabilities, losses or damage in respect of the assets, properties and businesses of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries as may customarily be carried or

any of the foregoing at the expense of the Parent at any time during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice; provided, further that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Parent nor any Restricted Subsidiary shall be
required to disclose, permit the inspection, examination or making of copies of or taking abstracts from, or discuss any document, information or other matter (i) that constitutes non-financial trade secrets or non-financial proprietary information of the Parent

Section 5.08.
Compliance with Laws. The Parent will comply, and will cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply, with the requirements of all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority
(including ERISA and all Environmental Laws), except to the extent the failure of the Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided that the requirements set forth in this
Section 5.08, as they pertain to compliance by any Foreign Subsidiary with Sanctions and anti-corruption Laws are subject to and limited by any Requirement of Law applicable to such Foreign Subsidiary in its relevant local jurisdiction.
Section 5.09.

The Parent will deliver to the Administrative Agent:
139

to any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory agency under any applicable Environmental Law, (B) any remedial action taken by or on behalf of the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in response to any Hazardous
Materials Activity or Environmental Claim, or (C) any pending or threatened Environmental Claim, that in the case of each of clauses (A), (B) and (C) above, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and
(ii)
reasonably promptly following the sending or receipt thereof by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, a copy of any and all written communications with respect to any Release required to be reported by the
Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory agency or any Release required to be remediated pursuant to any Environmental Law, that in each case would reasonably be expected to

of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and, to the extent required by Environmental Law, address with appropriate corrective or remedial action any Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous Material at or from any Facility, that, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (ii) make an appropriate response to any Environmental Claim against the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and discharge any obligations it may have to any Person thereunder,
where failure to do so could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; provided that it shall not be deemed to be a violation of this Section 5.09 if the Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries are in good faith
contesting such violation, liability for such Release or threatened Release or such Environmental Claim in accordance with applicable Environmental Law.
Section 5.10.
Designation of Subsidiaries. The Parent may at any time after the Closing Date designate (or re-designate) any subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided

such Unrestricted Subsidiary). The designation of any subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall constitute an Investment by the Parent therein at the date of designation in an amount equal to the portion of the fair market value of the net assets of such
subsidiary attributable to the Parent’s equity interest therein as estimated by the Parent in good faith (and such designation shall only be permitted to the extent such Investment is permitted under Section 6.06). The designation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary
as a Restricted Subsidiary shall constitute the incurrence or making, as applicable, at the time of designation of any then-existing Investment, Indebtedness or Lien of
140
such subsidiary, as applicable; provided that upon a re-designation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, the Parent shall be deemed to continue to have an Investment in the resulting Restricted Subsidiary in an amount (if positive) equal
to (a) the Parent’s “Investment” in such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such re-designation less (b) the portion of the fair market value of the net assets of such Restricted Subsidiary attributable to the Parent’s equity therein at the time of such redesignation.

subsidiaries (including to consummate the Refinancing and for capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital and/or purchase price adjustments, the payment of transaction fees and expenses, other Investments, Restricted Payments, Restricted Debt
Payments and any other purpose not prohibited by the terms of the Loan Documents). The Borrowers shall use the proceeds of the Swingline Loans made after the Closing Date to finance the working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of the
Borrowers and its subsidiaries and any other purpose not prohibited by the terms of the Loan Documents. VPI shall use the proceeds of the Initial Term Loans (i) to effect all or a portion of the Refinancing, (ii) to finance all or a portion of the Transactions
(including the payment of Transaction Costs) and (iii) for general corporate purposes. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that would entail a violation of Regulation U. The applicable Borrower

end of such Fiscal Quarter (or, in the cases of clauses (x) and (y), such longer period as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree), the Parent shall (A) cause such Restricted Subsidiary (other than any Excluded Subsidiary) to comply with the
requirements set forth in clause (a) of the definition of “Collateral and Guarantee Requirement” and (B) upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, cause the relevant Restricted Subsidiary (other than any Excluded Subsidiary) to deliver to the

Administrative Agent may reasonably agree), the Parent shall (A) cause such Loan Party to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such Collateral Documents as the Administrative Agent deems reasonably necessary or advisable to grant to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a perfected First Priority security interest in the Capital Stock of such new Restricted Subsidiary that is owned by any such Loan Party (provided that in no event shall more than 65% of the issued
and outstanding voting Capital Stock of any Specified Foreign Subsidiary or Disregarded U.S. Subsidiary be required to be so pledged) and (B) deliver to the Administrative Agent the certificates representing such Capital Stock, together with undated stock

Administrative Agent’s security interest therein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, (i) the Administrative Agent may grant extensions of time (including after the expiration of any relevant period, which apply retroactively) for the creation and perfection of

in the United States or Canada), (2) execute any guarantee, security agreement, pledge agreement, mortgage, deed or charge or governed under laws other than the laws of its jurisdiction of organization (other than with respect to Capital Stock or intellectual
property filings in the United States or Canada) or (3) make any foreign or multinational intellectual property filing, conduct any foreign or multinational intellectual property search or prepare any foreign or multinational schedule with respect to any assets
of any Loan Party (in each case outside of its jurisdiction of organization, other than with respect to intellectual property filings in Canada or the United States) or enter into any source code escrow arrangement or register any intellectual property, (vi) in no
event will the Collateral include any Excluded Assets (unless the relevant Loan Party shall agree in its discretion to pledge such asset in favor of the Secured Parties), (vii) no action shall be required to perfect any Lien with respect to (viii) any vehicle or
other asset subject to a certificate of title, or any retention of title, extended retention of title rights, or similar rights and/or (y) Letter-of-Credit Rights, in each case to the extent that a security interest therein cannot be perfected by filing a financing statement
under the UCC or PPSA (or similar filings in foreign jurisdictions) without the requirement to list any VIN, serial or other number and (ix) the Administrative Agent shall not require the taking of a Lien on, or require the perfection of any Lien granted in,

mortgage, stamp, intangibles or other tax or expenses relating to such Lien) outweighs the benefit to the Lenders of the security afforded thereby as determined in good faith by the Parent and the Administrative Agent.
Additionally, (i) no action shall be required to create or perfect a Lien in any asset in respect of which the creation or perfection of a security interest therein would (1) be prohibited by enforceable anti-assignment provisions set forth in any contract directly

ARTICLE 7

LOAN GUARANTEE
Section 7.01. Guarantee of the Loan Document Obligations. Subject to Section 7.02 and the terms of each Counterpart Agreement, the Guarantors jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee to Administrative
Agent for the ratable benefit of the
176
Secured Parties the due and punctual payment in full of all Obligations (other than Excluded Swap Obligations) when the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including
amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Laws) (collectively, the “Guaranteed Obligations”).
Section 7.02. Contribution by Guarantors; Indemnification; Subordination.
(a)
The Guarantors desire to allocate among themselves (collectively, the “Contributing Guarantors”), in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under the Loan Guarantee. Accordingly, in the event any payment or
distribution (including the sale of any assets) is made on any date by a Guarantor (a “Funding Guarantor”) under the Loan Guarantee or any other Loan Document such that its Aggregate Payments exceeds its Fair Share as of such date, such Funding
Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the other Contributing Guarantors in an amount sufficient to cause each Contributing Guarantor’s Aggregate Payments to equal its Fair Share as of such date. The allocation among Contributing
Guarantors of their obligations as set forth in this Agreement shall not be construed in any way to limit the liability of any Contributing Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document. Any Contributing Guarantor making a payment under this
Section 7.02(a) shall be subrogated to the rights of the Funding Guarantor under Section 7.02(b) below to the extent of such payment.
(b)
In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law, each Borrower agrees that (i) in the event a payment in respect of any Obligation of such Borrower shall be made by any
Guarantor under the Loan Guarantee, such Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such
payment and (ii) in the event any assets of any Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to any Loan Document to satisfy in whole or in part an Obligation owed to any Secured Party by such Borrower, such Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor in an amount
equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.
(c)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors under Sections 7.02(a) and (b) hereof and all other rights of the Guarantors of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law
or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the payment in full in cash of the Loan Document Obligations. No failure on the part of any Borrower or any Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 7.02(a) and (b) (or any other payments required
under Requirements of Law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder.
(d)

This Section 7.02 supersedes the Contribution Agreement (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) in its entirety and the Contribution Agreement (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) shall be of no further force or

effect.
Section 7.03. Payment by Subsidiary Guarantors. Subject to Section 7.02 and the terms of each Counterpart Agreement, the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree, in furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of
any other right which any Secured Party may have at law or in equity against any Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of any Borrower to pay any of the Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall
177
become due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or analogous
provisions of other Debtor Relief Laws), the Subsidiary Guarantors will upon demand pay, or cause to be paid, in Cash, to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of all
Guaranteed Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (including interest which, but for any Borrower’s becoming the subject of a case or proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law, would have accrued on
such Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not a claim is allowed against any Borrower for such interest in the related bankruptcy case) and all other Guaranteed Obligations then owed to Secured Parties as aforesaid.
Section 7.04. Liability of Guarantors Absolute. To the extent permitted under applicable law, each Guarantor agrees that its obligations hereunder are irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance which constitutes a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows:
(a)

this Loan Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and performance when due and not of collectability. This Loan Guarantee is a primary obligation of each Guarantor and not merely a contract of surety;

(b)
to the extent permitted under Requirements of Law, the Administrative Agent may enforce this Loan Guarantee upon the occurrence of an Event of Default notwithstanding the existence of any dispute between any Borrower and any
Secured Party with respect to the existence of such Event of Default;
(c)
the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any Borrower and the obligations of any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the obligations of any Borrower, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against such Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against any Borrower or any of such other guarantors and whether or not any Borrower is joined in any such action or actions;
(d)
payment by any Guarantor of a portion, but not all, of the Guaranteed Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or abridge any Guarantor’s liability for any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which has not been paid.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent is awarded a judgment in any suit brought to enforce any Guarantor’s covenant to pay a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations, such judgment shall not be deemed to release such
Guarantor from its covenant to pay the portion of the Guaranteed Obligations that is not the subject of such suit, and such judgment shall not, except to the extent satisfied by such Guarantor, limit, affect, modify or abridge any other Guarantor’s liability
hereunder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(e)
any Secured Party, upon such terms as it deems appropriate, without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability hereof or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of any
Guarantor’s liability hereunder, from time to time may (i) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the time,
178
place, manner or terms of payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse any offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto
and/or subordinate the payment of the same to the payment of any other obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations and take and hold security for the payment hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) release,
surrender, exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter, subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, any other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other
obligation of any Person (including any other Guarantor) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held by or for the benefit of such Secured Party in respect hereof or the Guaranteed Obligations and
direct the order or manner of sale thereof, or exercise any other right or remedy that such Secured Party may have against any such security, in each case as such Secured Party in its discretion may determine consistent herewith or the applicable Hedge
Agreement or agreement relating to Banking Services Obligations and any applicable security agreement, including foreclosure on any such security pursuant to one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is
commercially reasonable, and even though such action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Guarantor against any Borrower or any security for the Guaranteed Obligations; and
(vi) exercise any other rights available to it under the Loan Documents or any agreement relating to Derivative Transactions or Banking Services Obligations; and
(f)
this Loan Guarantee and the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for any reason (other than payment in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations), including the occurrence of any of the following, whether or not any Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert or enforce or agreement or election not to assert or
enforce, or the stay or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether arising under the Loan Documents or any agreements relating to Derivative
Transactions or Banking Services, at law, in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any other guarantee of or security for the payment or performance of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any consent to departure from, any of the terms or provisions (including provisions relating to events of default) hereof, any of the other Loan Documents, any agreements relating to
Derivative Transactions or Banking Services or any agreement or instrument executed pursuant thereto, or of any other guarantee or security for the Guaranteed Obligations, in each case whether or not in accordance with the terms hereof or such Loan
Document, such agreement relating to Derivatives Transactions or Banking Services or any agreement relating to such other guarantee or security; (iii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Guaranteed Obligations, or any agreement relating thereto,
at any time being found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect; (iv) the application of payments received from any source (other than payments received pursuant to the other Loan Documents, any agreements relating to Derivative Transactions
or Banking Services or from the proceeds of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, except to the extent such security also serves as collateral for indebtedness other than the Guaranteed Obligations) to the payment of indebtedness other than the
Guaranteed Obligations, even though any Secured Party might have elected to apply such payment to any part or all of the Guaranteed Obligations; (v) any Secured Party’s consent to the change, reorganization or termination of the corporate structure or
existence of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and to any corresponding restructuring of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) any failure to perfect or continue perfection of a security interest in any collateral
179
which secures any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, any defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which any Borrower may allege or assert against any Secured Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including
failure of consideration, breach of warranty, payment, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury; and (viii) any other act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing, which may or might in any manner or to any
extent vary the risk of any Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Section 7.05. Waivers by Guarantors. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor hereby waives, for the benefit of the Secured Parties: (a) any right to require any Secured Party, as a condition of payment or performance by
such Guarantor, to (i) proceed against any Borrower, any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Borrower, any such other guarantor or any
other Person, (iii) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any Deposit Account or credit on the books of any Secured Party in favor of any Borrower or any other Person, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Secured Party whatsoever;
(b) any defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of any Borrower or any other Guarantor including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of any Borrower or any other Guarantor from any cause other than satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) any defense based upon any
statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (d) any defense based upon any Secured Party’s errors or omissions in the administration of
the Guaranteed Obligations, except behavior which amounts to gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; (e) (i) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof and any legal or
equitable discharge of such Guarantor’s obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor’s liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and
(iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Secured Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (f) notices, demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and
notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance hereof, notices of default hereunder, agreements relating to Derivative Transactions or Banking Services or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification
of the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to any Borrower and notices of any of the matters referred to in Section 7.04 and any right to consent to any thereof; and (g) any defenses or benefits that may
be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms hereof.
Section 7.06. Guarantors’ Rights of Subrogation, Contribution, etc. Until the Termination Date, each Guarantor hereby waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that such Guarantor now
has or may hereafter have against any Borrower or any other Guarantor or any of its assets in connection with this Loan Guarantee or the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim, right or remedy arises in
equity, under contract, by statute, under common
180
law or otherwise and including (a) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against any Borrower with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in,
any claim, right or remedy that any Secured Party now has or may hereafter have against any Borrower, and (c) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Secured Party. In addition, until the
Termination Date, each Guarantor shall withhold exercise of any right of contribution such Guarantor may have against any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the Guaranteed Obligations, including any such right of contribution set forth in
Section 7.02 hereof. Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may have against any other Guarantor or against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution such Guarantor may have
against any such other guarantor, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights any Secured Party may have against any Borrower, to all right, title and interest any Secured Party may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right any Secured Party
may have against such other guarantor. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time prior to the Termination Date, such amount shall be held in trust for
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties to be credited and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in
accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 7.07. Subordination of Other Obligations. Any Indebtedness of any Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor now or hereafter owed to any Guarantor (the “Obligee Guarantor”) is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the
Guaranteed Obligations, and any such Indebtedness collected or received by the Obligee Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be
paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties to be credited and applied against the Guaranteed Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of the Obligee Guarantor under any other provision
hereof.
Section 7.08. Continuing Guarantee. This Loan Guarantee is a continuing guarantee and shall remain in effect until the Termination Date. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Loan Guarantee as to future
transactions giving rise to any Guaranteed Obligations.
Section 7.09. Authority of Subsidiary Guarantors or Borrowers. It is not necessary for any Secured Party to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Borrower or the officers, directors or any Agents acting or
purporting to act on behalf of any of them.
Section 7.10. Financial Condition of Borrowers. Any Credit Extension may be made to any Borrower or continued from time to time, and any agreements relating to Derivative Transactions or Banking Services may be entered into from
time to time, in each case without notice to or authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition of
181
any Borrower at the time of any such grant or continuation or at the time such agreement relating to Derivatives Transactions or Banking Services is entered into, as the case may be. No Secured Party shall have any obligation to disclose or discuss with any
Subsidiary Guarantor its assessment, or any Subsidiary Guarantor’s assessment, of the financial condition of any Borrower. Each Subsidiary Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from the applicable Borrower on a continuing basis concerning
the financial condition of such Borrower and its ability to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents and agreements relating to Derivative Transactions and Banking Services, and each Subsidiary Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and
keeping informed of the financial condition of such Borrower and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of any Secured Party
to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of any Borrower now known or hereafter known by any Secured Party.
Section 7.11. Bankruptcy, etc.
(a)
Until the Termination Date, no Subsidiary Guarantor shall, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent acting pursuant to the instructions of the Required Lenders, commence or join with any other Person in
commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency case, application or proceeding of or against any Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor. The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall not be reduced, limited, impaired,
discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any case, application or proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of any Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor
or by any defense which any Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.
(b)
Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which accrues after the commencement of any case, application or proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if interest on
any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of such case, application or proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Guaranteed Obligations if such case,
application or proceeding had not been commenced) shall be included in the Guaranteed Obligations because it is the intention of the Guarantors and the Secured Parties that the Guaranteed Obligations which are guaranteed by Guarantors pursuant hereto
should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve any Borrower of any portion of such Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantors will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors or similar Person to pay Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of Administrative Agent in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such case, application or proceeding is commenced.
(c)
In the event that all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations are paid by any Borrower, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated, as the case may be,
in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from any Secured Party as a preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded or recovered shall constitute
Guaranteed Obligations for all purposes hereunder.
182
Section 7.12. Discharge of Loan Guarantee upon Sale of Subsidiary Guarantor. If all of the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary Guarantor or any of its successors in interest hereunder shall be sold or otherwise Disposed of (including by merger,
amalgamation or consolidation) in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, the Loan Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor or such successor in interest, as the case may be, hereunder shall automatically be discharged and released without any
further action by any Secured Party or any other Person effective as of the time of such sale or other Disposition.
Section 7.13. Guarantee Limitations. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, the application of this Agreement to (including the Loan Guarantee and any obligation to contribute and indemnify
pursuant to Section 7.02 of) each Subsidiary Guarantor organized outside of the United States and Canada shall be (a) subject to the terms of Schedule 7.13 and (b) limited in the manner set forth in any Counterpart Agreement with respect to such Subsidiary
Guarantor, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Counterpart Agreement entered into prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement. Schedule 7.13 may be amended by the Administrative Agent and the Parent, without the
consent of any other Lender, Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or other Secured Party, in order to (i) incorporate additional provisions to address the accession of any Loan Party in an additional jurisdiction after the date hereof, (ii) cure omissions or
defects or make changes of a technical nature or (iii) accommodate any Change in Law.

such Commitments shall terminate immediately along with the obligation of Issuing Banks to issue any Letter of Credit, (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due
and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall
become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers and (iii) require that the applicable Borrower deposit in the LC Collateral Account an additional
amount in Cash as reasonably requested by the Issuing Banks (not to exceed 100% of the relevant face amount) of the then outstanding LC Exposure (minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account); provided that (A) upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in clause (f) or (g) of this Article, any such Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other
obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers, and the obligation of the Borrowers to Cash
collateralize the outstanding Letters of Credit as aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further action of the Administrative Agent or any Lender and (B) during the continuance of any Event of Default arising under Section 6.15,
after giving effect to the proviso to Section 8.01(c) (X) solely upon the request of the Required Revolving Lenders (but not the Required Lenders or any other Lender or group of Lenders), the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Parent, (1) terminate
the Revolving Credit Commitments, and thereupon such Revolving Credit Commitments shall terminate immediately, (2) declare the Revolving Loans then outstanding to
186
be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Revolving Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with
accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder in respect of the Revolving Loans, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice in respect thereof of any kind,
all of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers and (3) require that applicable Borrower deposit in the LC Collateral Account an additional amount in Cash as reasonably requested by the Issuing Banks (not to exceed 100% of the relevant face amount) of
the then outstanding LC Exposure (minus the amount then on deposit in the LC Collateral Account) and (Y) subject to the Financial Covenant Standstill, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the
Borrowers, declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so
declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby waived by the Borrowers. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, subject to any applicable intercreditor agreement, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, exercise
any rights and remedies provided to the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents or at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the UCC.
ARTICLE 9

THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
Section 9.01. Appointment. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, on behalf of itself and its applicable Affiliates and in their respective capacities as such and as Secured Parties in respect of any Secured Hedging Obligations or
Banking Services Obligations, as applicable, hereby irrevocably appoints Barclays (or any successor appointed pursuant hereto) as Administrative Agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the
other Loan Documents and any other documents with respect to the rights of the Secured Parties and the Collateral as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent
by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Subject to Section 9.13, each of the Secured Parties hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent (as collateral agent) to act as the agent of (and to hold any security interest, other than any security interest governed
by French law, created by the Loan Documents for and on behalf of or on trust for) such Secured Party for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together
with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Secured Party agrees that any such actions by the Administrative Agent shall bind such Secured Party.
Any Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term “Lender”
or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, unless the context otherwise requires or unless such Person is in fact not a
187
Lender, include each Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage
in any kind of business with any Loan Party or any subsidiary of any Loan Party or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Administrative Agent or its
Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall
not be under any obligation to provide such information to them.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default exists, and the use of the term “agent” herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or
express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Requirements of Law; it being understood that such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers that are expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents and
which the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the relevant circumstances as provided in
Section 10.02); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable
Requirements of Law and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their
Restricted Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any action taken or
not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary,
under the relevant circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in connection with its duties expressly set forth
herein. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Parent or any Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection
with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any covenant, agreement or other term or condition set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien on the Collateral or the existence, value or sufficiency of the Collateral, (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article 4 or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or (vii) any property, book or record of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof; provided, further, that the
foregoing paragraph is solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and not any Lender.
188
The Administrative Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential provider of Secured Hedging Obligations or Banking Services Obligations) and
the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender, Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank Issuer for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all
Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” and any co-agents, subagents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and
remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article 9 and Article 10 (as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan
Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.
Section 9.02. Enforcement. Each Lender agrees that, except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, it will not take any enforcement action hereunder or under any other Loan Document, accelerate the Loan Document
Obligations under any Loan Document, or exercise any right that it might otherwise have under applicable law or otherwise to credit bid at any foreclosure sale, UCC sale, any sale under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or other similar Dispositions of
Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, except as otherwise expressly limited herein, a Lender may take action to preserve or enforce its rights against a Loan Party where a deadline or limitation period is applicable that would, absent such
action, bar enforcement of the Loan Document Obligations held by such Lender, including the filing of a proof of claim in a case under the Bankruptcy Code.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party agree that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize
upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Loan Guarantee; it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms
hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the other Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or
in the event of any other Disposition (including pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code), (A) the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or
payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale, to use and apply all or any portion of the Loan Document Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Administrative
Agent at such Disposition and (B) the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of all or any portion of such Collateral at any such Disposition.
No holder of any Secured Hedging Obligation or Banking Services Obligation in its respective capacity as such shall have any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party
under this Agreement.
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering into a Hedge Agreement with respect to any Secured Hedging Obligation and/or by entering into documentation in connection with any Banking Services Obligation, each
of the other Secured Parties hereby authorizes and shall be deemed to authorize) the Administrative Agent, on behalf
189
of all Secured Parties, to take any of the following actions upon the instruction of the Required Lenders:
(a)
consent to the Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral free and clear of the Liens securing the Obligations in connection with any Disposition pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable
Debtor Relief Law), including Section 363 thereof;
(b)
credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in connection with any Disposition of all or any portion of the
Collateral pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable Debtor Relief Law), including under Section 363 thereof;
(c)
credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in connection with any Disposition of all or any portion of the
Collateral pursuant to the applicable provisions of the UCC (or other applicable Debtor Relief Law), including pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the UCC;
(d)
credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), in connection with any foreclosure or other Disposition
conducted in accordance with applicable law following the occurrence of an Event of Default, including by power of sale, judicial action or otherwise; and/or
(e)

estimate the amount of any contingent or unliquidated Obligations of such Lender or other Secured Party;

it being understood that no Lender shall be required to fund any new amount in connection with any purchase of all or any portion of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the foregoing clause (b), (c) or (d) without its prior written consent.
Each Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to credit bid any part of the Obligations or to purchase or retain or acquire any portion of the Collateral; provided that, in connection with any credit bid or
purchase described under clause (b), (c) or (d) of the preceding paragraph, the Obligations owed to all of the Secured Parties (other than with respect to contingent or unliquidated liabilities as set forth in the next succeeding paragraph) may be, and shall be,
credit bid by the Administrative Agent on a ratable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Article 9 shall limit any rights of any of the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code (or the corresponding provisions
of any other applicable Debtor Relief Law).
With respect to any contingent or unliquidated claim that is a Secured Obligation, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized by the Secured Parties, but is not required, to estimate the amount thereof for purposes of any credit bid or
purchase described in the second preceding paragraph so long as the estimation of the amount or liquidation of such claim would not unduly delay the ability of the Administrative Agent to credit bid the Obligations or purchase the Collateral in the relevant
Disposition. In the event that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects not to estimate any such contingent or unliquidated claim or any such claim cannot be estimated without unduly delaying the ability of the Administrative Agent
to consummate any credit bid or purchase in accordance with the second preceding paragraph, then any contingent or unliquidated claims not so estimated shall be disregarded, shall not be credit
190
bid, and shall not be entitled to any interest in the portion or the entirety of the Collateral purchased by means of such credit bid.
Each Secured Party whose Obligations are credit bid under clause (b), (c) or (d) of the third preceding paragraph shall be entitled to receive interests in the Collateral or any other asset acquired in connection with such credit bid (or in the
Capital Stock of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such acquisition) on a ratable basis in accordance with the percentage obtained by dividing (x) the amount of the Obligations of such Secured Party that were credit bid in such
credit bid or other Disposition by (y) the aggregate amount of all Obligations that were credit bid in such credit bid or other Disposition.
Section 9.03. Bankruptcy. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, each Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether
the principal of any Loan or LC Exposure is then due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(i)
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans or LC Exposure and all other Loan Document Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file
such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts to the extent due to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.12 and 10.03) allowed
in such judicial proceeding; and
(ii)

to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same.

Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each Issuing Bank to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and,
in the event that the Administrative Agent consents to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amount due to the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.12 and 10.03.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Loan Document Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any Issuing Bank or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any Issuing Bank in any such proceeding.
Section 9.04. Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any
electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it
orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance
191
with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is
satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent has received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Parent), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
Section 9.05. Delegation. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-Agents appointed by it. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all of their respective duties and exercise their respective rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative
Agent and any such sub-agent and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent.
Section 9.06. Resignation. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving thirty days’ written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Parent. If the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a
Defaulting Lender, either the Required Lenders or the Parent may, upon thirty days’ notice, remove the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or delivery of any such notice of removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right,
with the consent of the Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a commercial bank, trust company or other Person reasonably acceptable to the Parent with offices in the U.S.; provided
that during the existence and continuation of a Specified Event of Default, no consent of the Parent shall be required. If no successor shall have been appointed as provided above and accepted such appointment within thirty days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or the Administrative Agent receives notice of removal, then (a) in the case of a retirement, the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consent of the Parent) or (b) in the case of a removal, the Parent may, after consulting with the Required Lenders, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that (x) in the case of a retirement, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Parent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks that no qualifying Person has accepted such
appointment or (y) in the case of a removal, the Parent notifies the Required Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then, in each case, such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice
and (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent in its capacity as
collateral agent for the Secured Parties for perfection purposes, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) all payments, communications and
determinations required to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to
192
each Lender and each Issuing Bank directly (and each Lender and each Issuing Bank will cooperate with the Parent to enable the Parent to take such actions), until such time as the Required Lenders or the Parent, as applicable, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, as provided for above in this Article 9. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder
(other than its obligations under Section 10.13 hereof). The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor
Administrative Agent. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-Agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the relevant Person was acting as Administrative Agent (including for this purpose holding any collateral security following the retirement or removal of the
Administrative Agent).
Any resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent hereunder shall also constitute its resignation as the Swingline Lender effective as of the date of effectiveness of its removal or resignation as Administrative Agent as provided above.
In the event of any such resignation as Swingline Lender, the Parent shall be entitled to appoint any Revolving Lender that is willing to accept such appointment as successor Swingline Lender hereunder. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Swingline
Lender hereunder by a successor Swingline Lender, such successor Swingline Lender shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Swingline Lender and the resigning Swingline Lender shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations in such capacity hereunder. In the event the Swingline Lender resigns, the applicable Borrowers shall promptly repay all outstanding Swingline Loans on the effective date of such resignation (which repayment
may be effectuated with the proceeds of a Borrowing).
Each Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of
their respective Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent
shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or any Issuing Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or
any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.
Section 9.07. Arrangers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Arrangers shall not have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement, except in their respective capacities, as applicable, as
the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender hereunder.
193
Section 9.08. Release of Loan Guarantees; Collateral. Each Secured Party irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to, and the Administrative Agent shall:
(a)
without limiting Section 10.22, release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon the occurrence of the Termination Date, (ii) that is sold or to be sold or transferred as
part of or in connection with any Disposition permitted under the Loan Documents (or other disposition not restricted hereby) to a Person that is not a Loan Party, (iii) that does not constitute (or ceases to constitute) Collateral (including by becoming an
Excluded Asset), (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its Loan Guarantee otherwise in accordance with the Loan Documents, (v) as required under clause (d) below
or (vi) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of Lenders as shall be necessary under the relevant circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) in accordance with Section 10.02;
(b)
without limiting Section 10.22, release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Guarantee (i) if such Person ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a single
transaction or series of related transactions or any event or other circumstance permitted hereunder) and/or (ii) upon the occurrence of the Termination Date;
(c)
subordinate (and, in the case of Section 6.02(uu), release) any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Sections
6.02(c), 6.02(d), 6.02(e), 6.02(f), 6.02(g), 6.02(l), 6.02(k) 6.02(m), 6.02(n), 6.02(o), 6.02(q), 6.02(r), 6.02(v)(ii), 6.02(x), 6.02(y), 6.02(z)(i), 6.02(bb), 6.02(cc), 6.02(dd), 6.02(ee), 6.02(ff), 6.02(gg), 6.02(ii), 6.02(ll) and 6.02(uu) (and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect of any thereof to the extent such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be secured under Section 6.02(k)); and
(d)
enter into subordination, intercreditor, collateral trust and/or similar agreements (and any amendments thereto) with respect to Indebtedness (including any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and any amendment thereto) that is
(i) required or permitted to be subordinated hereunder or pari passu with the Liens securing the Loan Document Obligations and/or (ii) secured by Liens, and with respect to which Indebtedness and/or Liens, this Agreement contemplates an intercreditor,
subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement.
Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Loan
Party from its obligations under the Loan Guarantee or its Lien on any Collateral pursuant to this Article 9. In each case as specified in this Article 9, the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to), at the Parent’s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest
granted under the Collateral Documents, to subordinate its interest therein, or to release such Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Guarantee, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Article 9. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively as to any of the matters described in this Section 9.08 and Section 10.22 (including as to its authority hereunder and thereunder) on a certificate or similar instrument provided to it
by any Loan Party without further inquiry or investigation, which certificate shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent by the Loan Parties upon request.
194
Section 9.09. Intercreditor Agreements. The Administrative Agent is authorized to enter into any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement contemplated hereby with
respect to any (a) Indebtedness (i) that is (A) required or permitted to be subordinated hereunder or pari passu with or senior to the Liens securing the Loan Document Obligations and/or (B) secured by Liens and (ii) with respect to which Indebtedness and/or
Liens, this Agreement contemplates an intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement (any such other intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust and/or similar agreement, an “Additional Agreement”) and/or (b) Secured Hedging
Obligations and/or Banking Services Obligations, whether or not constituting Indebtedness, and each Secured Party acknowledges that any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Agreement is binding upon them. Each Secured Party hereby
(a) acknowledges that it has received a copy of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and consents to its terms, (b) agrees that it will be bound by, and will not take any action contrary to, the provisions of any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Agreement and (c) authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to enter into any Additional Agreement (including any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement) and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations to the provisions
thereof. The foregoing provisions are intended as an inducement to the Secured Parties to extend credit to the Borrowers, and the Secured Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of such provisions and the provisions of any Acceptable Intercreditor
Agreement and/or any other Additional Agreement.
Section 9.10. Indemnification by Lenders. To the extent that the Administrative Agent (or any Affiliate thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrowers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Lenders will
reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any Affiliate thereof) in proportion to their respective Applicable Percentages (determined as if there were no Defaulting Lenders) for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent (or any Affiliate thereof) in performing its duties hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent’s (or such Affiliate’s) gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).
Section 9.11. Withholding Taxes. To the extent required by any applicable Requirements of Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender (which term shall include any Issuing Bank for purposes of this
Section 9.11) an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of
any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction
of, withholding tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify fully and hold harmless Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by a Loan Party pursuant to Section 2.17 and without limiting or
expanding the
195
obligation of any Loan Party to do so) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Taxes or otherwise, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses and any other out-of-pocket expenses, whether or not such Tax
was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The agreements in
this Section 9.11 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of this Agreement and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Loan
Document Obligations.
Section 9.12. Quebec. For the purposes of any security granted at any time by any Canadian Loan Party pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec, each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes and appoints the Administrative Agent (and,
for the purposes of any existing security, confirms the appointment of the Administrative Agent in its capacity as collateral agent) to act as the hypothecary representative (fondé de pouvoir) (within the meaning of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec)
for the Secured Parties (including for the holder of any debenture, bond or other title of indebtedness issued by any Canadian Loan Party pursuant to the terms of any deed of hypothec) in order to hold any hypothec granted under the laws of the Province of
Quebec (including as security for any such debenture, bond or other title of indebtedness issued by any Canadian Loan Party (or as security in respect of any Obligations)) and to exercise such rights and duties as are conferred upon a hypothecary
representative (fondé de pouvoir) under the relevant deed of hypothec and applicable laws (with the power to delegate any such rights or duties). Moreover, in respect of any pledge by any such Canadian Loan Party of any such debenture, bond or other title
of indebtedness as security in respect of any Obligations, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as collateral agent) shall also be authorized to hold such debenture, bond or other title of indebtedness as agent, mandatary, custodian and pledgee for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, the whole notwithstanding the provisions of Section 32 of the An Act respecting the Special Powers of Legal Persons (Quebec). The execution prior to the date hereof by the Administrative Agent (or its predecessor in the
capacity as collateral agent) of any deed of hypothec or other security documents made pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec, is hereby ratified and confirmed. Any person who becomes a Secured Party shall be deemed to have consented to and
ratified the foregoing appointment of the Administrative Agent as hypothecary representative (fondé de pouvoir), agent, mandatary and custodian on behalf of all Secured Parties (including for any holder of any such debenture, bond or other title of
indebtedness issued by any Canadian Loan Party), including such person. For greater certainty, the Administrative Agent, when acting as the hypothecary representative (fondé de pouvoir), shall have the same rights, powers, immunities, indemnities and
exclusions from liability as are prescribed in favor of the Administrative Agent in this Agreement, which shall apply mutatis mutandis. In the event of the resignation and appointment of a successor Administrative Agent, such successor of the Administrative
Agent shall also act as the hypothecary representative (fondé de pouvoir) without any further action or formality, other than the filing of a notice of replacement in the applicable Quebec Register in accordance with Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec,
and as agent, mandatary and custodian for the purposes set forth above. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender or Issuing Bank shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any other Lender or Issuing Bank. The Lenders and Issuing
Banks are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender or Issuing Bank shall be liable for the acts
196
or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender or Issuing Bank.
Section 9.13. Certain Foreign Collateral Matters. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, the Collateral Documents and the Liens (and the relative rights of the Secured Parties and the Administrative
Agent) granted by a Subsidiary Guarantor organized outside of the United States and Canada shall be subject to the terms of Schedule 9.13. Schedule 9.13 may be amended by the Administrative Agent and the Parent, without the consent of any other Lender,
Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or other Secured Party, in order to (i) incorporate additional provisions to address the accession of any Loan Party in an additional jurisdiction after the date hereof, (ii) cure omissions or defects or make changes of a
technical nature or (iii) accommodate any Change in Law.

approved by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent or the Parent (on behalf of any Loan Party) may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures set

Section 10.02. Waivers; Amendments.
(a)
No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by

any party thereto therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same is permitted by this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which it is given. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, to the extent permitted by law, the making of a Loan or the issuance of any Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank
may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.
(b)
Subject to clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) of this Section 10.02(b) and Sections 10.02(c) and (d) below and to Section 10.05(f), neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be
waived, amended or modified, except (i) in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Parent and the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) or (ii) in
the case of any other Loan Document (other than any waiver, amendment or modification to effectuate any modification thereto expressly contemplated by the terms of such other Loan Document), pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Administrative Agent and each Loan Party that is party thereto, with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing:
(A)

except with the consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (but without requiring the consent of the Required Lenders), no such agreement shall;

(1)
increase the Commitment of such Lender (other than with respect to any Incremental Facility pursuant to Section 2.22 in respect of which such Lender has agreed to be an Additional
Lender); it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent, representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default,
mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall constitute an increase of any Commitment of such Lender;
199
(2)
reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan owed to such Lender or any amount due to such Lender on any Loan Installment Date (other than, in each case, any waiver of, or
consent to or departure from, any Default or Event of Default or any mandatory prepayment; it being understood that no change in (i) the definition of “First Lien Leverage Ratio” or any other ratio used
in the calculation of any mandatory prepayment (including any component definition thereof) or (ii) the MFN Provision shall constitute a reduction or forgiveness of any principal amount due hereunder);
(3)
(x) extend the scheduled final maturity of any Loan or (y) postpone any Loan Installment Date, any Interest Payment Date or the date of any scheduled payment of any fee, in each
case payable to such Lender hereunder (in each case, other than any extension for administrative reasons agreed by the Administrative Agent) (other than, in each case, any waiver of, or consent or
departure from, any Default or Event of Default or any mandatory prepayment; it being understood that no change in the definition of “First Lien Leverage Ratio” or any other ratio used in the calculation
of any mandatory prepayment (including any component definition thereof) shall constitute such an extension or postponement);
(4)
reduce the rate of interest (other than to waive any Default or Event of Default or obligation of the Borrowers to pay interest at the default rate of interest under Section 2.13(d), which
shall only require the consent of the Required Lenders, or to waive adjustments in interest rate or fees on account of late delivery of financial statements or a determination with respect to financial
statements pursuant to the final paragraphs of the definitions of “Applicable Rate” and “Commitment Fee Rate”, which shall only require the consent of the Required Lenders with respect to the Initial
Term Loans or the Required Revolving Lenders, as applicable) or the amount of any fee owed to such Lender; it being understood that no change in (i) the definition of “First Lien Leverage Ratio” or any
other ratio used in the calculation of the Applicable Rate or the Commitment Fee Rate, or in the calculation of any other interest or fee due hereunder (including any component definition thereof) or
(ii) the MFN Provision shall constitute a reduction in any rate of interest or fee hereunder;
(5)
extend the expiry date of such Lender’s Commitment; it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent,
representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of any Commitment shall constitute an extension of any Commitment of any Lender; and
(6)
waive, amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.18(b) of this Agreement in a manner that would by its terms alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby (except in
connection with any transaction permitted under Sections 2.22, 2.23, 10.02(c) and/or 10.05(g) or as otherwise provided in this Section 10.02); and
200
(B)

no such agreement shall:

(1)
change (x) any of the provisions of Section 10.02(a) or Section 10.02(b) or the definition of “Required Lenders” to reduce any voting percentage required to waive, amend or modify
any right thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the prior written consent of each Lender or (y) the definition of “Required Revolving Lenders” without the prior
written consent of each Revolving Lender (it being understood that neither the consent of the Required Lenders nor the consent of any other Lender shall be required in connection with any change to the
definition of “Required Revolving Lenders”);
(2)
release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Lien granted pursuant to the Loan Documents (except as otherwise permitted herein or in the other Loan Documents, including
pursuant to Article 9 or Section 10.22 hereof or pursuant to any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement), without the prior written consent of each Lender; or
(3)
release all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees under the Loan Guarantee (except as otherwise permitted herein or in the other Loan Documents, including pursuant to
Article 9 or Section 10.22 hereof), without the prior written consent of each Lender;
(C)
solely with the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders (but without the consent of the Required Lenders or any other Lender), any such agreement may (x) waive, amend or modify Section 6.15
(or the definition of “First Lien Leverage Ratio” or any component definition thereof, in each case, as any such definition is used solely for purposes of Section 6.15) or waive any Default or Event of Default in respect of
Section 6.15 (other than as permitted under clause (y)), (y) waive, amend or modify any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 hereof as it pertains to any Revolving Loan and/or Additional Revolving Loan and/or
(z) waive any Default or Event of Default that results from any representation made or deemed made by any Loan Party in any Loan Document in connection with any Credit Extension under the Revolving Facility being
untrue in any material respect as of the date made or deemed made;
(D)
solely with the consent of the relevant Issuing Bank and, in the case of clause (x), the Administrative Agent, any such agreement may (x) increase or decrease the Letter of Credit Sublimit or
(y) waive, amend or modify any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 hereof as it pertains to the issuance of any Letter of Credit; and
201
(E)
solely with the consent of the Parent and applicable Class or Classes of Revolving Lenders and/or, if applicable, Issuing Banks, subject to the provisions of Section 1.10, this Agreement may be
amended or otherwise modified to permit the availability of Revolving Loans and/or Letters of Credit denominated in a currency other than Dollars and to make technical changes to this Agreement and any other Loan
Document to accommodate the inclusion of any such new currency;
provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent may also amend the Commitment Schedule to reflect assignments entered into pursuant to Section 10.05, Commitment reductions or terminations pursuant to Section 2.09,
incurrences of Additional Commitments or Additional Loans pursuant to Sections 2.22, 2.23 or 10.02(c) and reductions or terminations of any such Additional Commitments or Additional Loans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased without the consent of such Defaulting Lender (it being understood
that any Commitment or Loan held or deemed held by any Defaulting Lender shall be excluded from any vote hereunder that requires the consent of any Lender, except as expressly provided in Section 2.21(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without
limiting the provisions of Section 2.22(g), this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Parent (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this
Agreement and to permit any extension of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the relevant benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) to include
appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Lenders prior to such inclusion.
(c)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended:

(i)
with the written consent of the Parent and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans to permit the refinancing or replacement of all or any portion of the outstanding Term Loans under any
applicable Class (any such loans being refinanced or replaced, the “Replaced Term Loans”) with one or more replacement term loans hereunder (“Replacement Term Loans”) pursuant to a Refinancing Amendment; provided that
(A) the aggregate principal amount of any Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the Replaced
202
Term Loans (plus (1) any additional amounts permitted to be incurred under Section 6.01 and, to the extent any such additional amounts are secured, the related Liens are permitted under Section 6.02 and plus (2) the
amount of accrued interest, penalties and premium (including any tender premium) thereon, any committed but undrawn amount and underwriting discounts, fees (including upfront fees, original issue discount or initial
yield payments), commissions and expenses associated therewith),
(B)
subject to the Permitted Earlier Maturity Indebtedness Exception, any Replacement Term Loans (other than customary bridge loans with a maturity date of not longer than one year; provided that any
loans, notes, securities or other Indebtedness which are exchanged for or otherwise replace such bridge loans shall be subject to the requirements of this clause (B)) must have a final maturity date that is equal to or later
than the final maturity date of, and have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity equal to or greater than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of, the Replaced Term Loans at the time of the relevant refinancing,
(C)
any Replacement Term Loans may be pari passu or junior in right of payment and pari passu (without regard to the control of remedies) or junior with respect to the Collateral with the remaining
portion of the Initial Term Loans or Additional Term Loans (provided that if pari passu or junior as to Collateral, such Replacement Term Loans shall be subject to an Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and may, at the
option of the Parent, be documented in a separate agreement or agreements), or be unsecured,
(D)

if any Replacement Term Loans are secured, such Replacement Term Loans may not be secured by any assets other than the Collateral,

(E)

if any Replacement Term Loans are guaranteed, such Replacement Term Loans may not be guaranteed by any Person other than one or more Loan Parties,

(F)
any Replacement Term Loans that are pari passu with the Initial Term Loans in right of payment and security may participate (A) in any voluntary prepayment of Term Loans as set forth in
Section 2.11(a)(i) and (B) in any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans as set forth in Section 2.11(b)(vi),
(G)

any Replacement Term Loans shall have pricing (including interest, fees and premiums) and, subject to preceding clause
203

(F), optional prepayment and redemption terms and, subject to preceding clause (B), an amortization schedule, as the Parent and the lenders providing such Replacement Term Loans may agree,
(H)
the covenants and events of default of any Replacement Term Loans (excluding pricing, interest, fees, rate floors, premiums, optional prepayment or redemption terms, security and maturity, subject
to preceding clauses (B) through (G)) shall be (i) substantially identical to, or (taken as a whole) no more favorable (as determined by the Parent in good faith) to the lenders providing such Replacement Term Loans than,
those applicable to the Replaced Term Loans (other than covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the latest Maturity Date of such Replaced Term Loans (in each case, as of the date of incurrence of
such Replacement Term Loans)), (ii) then-current market terms (as determined by the Parent in good faith at the time of incurrence or issuance (or the obtaining of a commitment with respect thereto)) for the applicable
type of Indebtedness or (iii) reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (it being agreed that covenants and events of default of any Replacement Term Loans that are more favorable to the lenders or the agent of
such Replacement Term Loans than those contained in the Loan Documents and are then conformed (or added) to the Loan Documents pursuant to the applicable Refinancing Amendment shall thereafter be deemed
acceptable to the Administrative Agent), and
(ii)
with the written consent of the Parent and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Revolving Facility to permit the refinancing or replacement of all or any portion of any Revolving Credit Commitment under
the applicable Class (any such Revolving Credit Commitment being refinanced or replaced, a “Replaced Revolving Facility”) with a replacement revolving facility hereunder (a “Replacement Revolving Facility”) pursuant to a
Refinancing Amendment; provided that:
(A)
the aggregate principal amount of any Replacement Revolving Facility shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the Replaced Revolving Facility (plus (x) any additional amounts permitted
to be incurred under Section 6.01 and, to the extent any such additional amounts are secured, the related Liens are permitted under Section 6.02 and (y) the amount of accrued interest, penalties and premium thereon, any
committed but undrawn amounts and underwriting discounts, fees (including upfront fees and original issue discount), commissions and expenses associated therewith),
(B)

no Replacement Revolving Facility (other than customary bridge loans with a maturity date of not longer than one year; provided
204

that any loans, notes, securities or other Indebtedness which are exchanged for or otherwise replace such bridge loans shall be subject to the requirements of this clause (B)) may have a final maturity date (or require
commitment reductions) prior to the final maturity date of the relevant Replaced Revolving Facility at the time of such refinancing,
(C)
any Replacement Revolving Facility may be pari passu or junior in right of payment and pari passu (without regard to the control of remedies) or junior with respect to the Collateral with the
remaining portion of any Revolving Credit Commitments (provided that if pari passu or junior as to Collateral, such Replacement Revolving Facility shall be subject to an Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and may, at
the option of the Parent, be documented in a separate agreement or agreements), or be unsecured,
(D)

if any Replacement Revolving Facility is secured, it may not be secured by any assets other than the Collateral,

(E)

if any Replacement Revolving Facility is guaranteed, it may not be guaranteed by any Person other than one or more Loan Parties,

(F)
any Replacement Revolving Facility shall be subject to the “ratability” provisions applicable to Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and Extended Revolving Loans set forth in the proviso to
Section 2.23(a)(i), mutatis mutandis, to the same extent as if fully set forth in this Section 10.02(c)(ii),
(G)
any Replacement Revolving Facility shall have pricing (including interest, fees and premiums) and, subject to the preceding clause (F), optional prepayment and redemption terms as the Parent and
the lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Facility may agree,
(H)
the covenants and events of default of any Replacement Revolving Facility (excluding pricing, interest, fees, rate floors, premiums, optional prepayment or redemption terms, security and maturity,
subject to preceding clauses (B) through (G)) shall be (i) substantially identical to, or (taken as a whole) no more favorable (as determined by the Parent in good faith) to the lenders providing such Replacement Revolving
Facility than, those applicable to the Replaced Revolving Facility (other than covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the latest Maturity Date of such Replaced Revolving Facility (in each case, as of
the date of incurrence of the relevant Replacement Revolving Facility)), (ii) then-current market terms (as
205
determined by the Parent in good faith at the time of incurrence or issuance (or the obtaining of a commitment with respect thereto)) for the applicable type of Indebtedness or (iii) reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent (it being agreed that covenants and events of default of any Replacement Revolving Facility that are more favorable to the lenders or the agent of such Replacement Revolving Facility than those
contained in the Loan Documents and are then conformed (or added) to the Loan Documents pursuant to the applicable Refinancing Amendment shall be deemed acceptable to the Administrative Agent), and
(I)
the commitments in respect of the Replaced Revolving Facility shall be terminated, and all loans outstanding thereunder and all fees then due and payable in connection therewith shall be paid in full,
in each case on the date such Replacement Revolving Facility is implemented.
Each party hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement shall be amended by the Parent, the Administrative Agent and the lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans or the Replacement
Revolving Facility, as applicable, to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of such Replacement Term Loans or Replacement Revolving Facility, as applicable, incurred or implemented pursuant thereto (including any
amendment necessary to treat the loans and commitments subject thereto as a separate “tranche” and “Class” of Loans and/or commitments hereunder). It is understood that any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of any Replacement Term Loans
or any Replacement Revolving Facility may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide such Replacement Term Loans or Replacement Revolving Facility.
(d)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.02 or any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, (i) the Parent and the Administrative Agent may, without the input or
consent of any Lender, amend, supplement and/or waive any guarantee, collateral security agreement, pledge agreement and/or related document (if any) executed in connection with this Agreement to (x) comply with any Requirements of Law or (y) cause
any such guarantee, collateral security agreement, pledge agreement or other document to be consistent with this Agreement and/or the relevant other Loan Documents, (ii) the Parent and the Administrative Agent may, without the input or consent of any
other Lender (other than the relevant Lenders (including Additional Lenders) providing Loans under such Sections), effect amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary in the reasonable opinion of the Parent and the
Administrative Agent to (A) effect the provisions of Sections 2.22, 2.23, 5.12, 5.14, 5.15, 5.16, 6.11, 7.13, 9.13, 10.02(c) or 11.09, or any other provision specifying that any waiver, amendment or modification may be made with the consent or approval of
the Administrative Agent and/or (B) add terms (including representations and warranties, conditions, prepayments, covenants or events of default), in connection with the addition of any Loan or Commitment hereunder or the incurrence of any Incremental
Equivalent Debt, any Replacement Term Loans, any Replacement Revolving Facility, any Replacement Debt and/or any Refinancing Indebtedness incurred in reliance on Section 6.01(p) with respect to Indebtedness originally incurred in reliance on
Section 6.01(z) that
206
are favorable to the then-existing Lenders, as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent (it being understood that, where applicable, any such amendment may be effectuated as part of an Incremental Facility Amendment and/or a Refinancing
Amendment), (iii) if the Administrative Agent and the Parent have jointly identified any ambiguity, mistake, defect, inconsistency, obvious error or any error or omission of a technical or administrative nature or any necessary or desirable technical change, in
each case, in any provision of any Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent and the Parent shall be permitted to amend such provision solely to address such matter as reasonably determined by them acting jointly without the input or consent of any
Lender, (iv) the Administrative Agent and the Parent may amend, restate, amend and restate or otherwise modify any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement as provided therein or to give effect thereto or to carry out the purpose thereof without the input or
consent of any Lender and (v) any amendment, waiver or modification of any term or provision that directly affects Lenders under one or more Classes and does not directly affect Lenders under one or more other Classes may be effected with the consent of
Lenders owning 50% of the aggregate commitments or Loans of such directly affected Class in lieu of the consent of the Required Lenders.
Section 10.03. Expenses; Indemnity.
(a)
Subject to Section 10.05(f), the Borrowers shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by each Arranger, the Administrative Agent and their respective Affiliates (but limited, in the case of legal fees
and expenses, to the actual reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, disbursements and other charges of one firm of outside counsel to all such Persons taken as a whole and, if necessary, of one local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction to all such
Persons, taken as a whole) in connection with the syndication and distribution (including via the Internet or through a service such as Intralinks) of the Credit Facilities, the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of the Loan Documents and any
related documentation, including in connection with any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document (whether or not the transactions contemplated thereby are consummated, but only to the extent the preparation of any such
amendment, modification or waiver was requested by the Borrowers) and (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Issuing Banks or the Lenders or any of their respective Affiliates
(but limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to the actual reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, disbursements and other charges of one firm of outside counsel to all such Persons taken as a whole and, if necessary, of one local counsel in any
relevant jurisdiction to all such Persons, taken as a whole) in connection with the enforcement, collection or protection of their respective rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including their respective rights under this Section, or in connection
with the Loans made and/or Letters of Credit issued hereunder. Except to the extent required to be paid on the Closing Date, all amounts due under this paragraph (a) shall be payable by the Borrowers within 30 days of receipt by the Parent of an invoice
setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail, together with backup documentation supporting the relevant reimbursement request.
(b)
The Borrowers shall indemnify each Arranger, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, each Lender and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold
each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (but limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to the actual reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to all
Indemnitees taken as a whole and, if reasonably necessary, one local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction to all Indemnitees taken as a whole and, solely in the case of an actual or perceived
207
conflict of interest after the affected Person notifies the Parent of such conflict, (x) one additional counsel to all similarly situated affected Indemnitees taken as a whole and (y) one additional local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction to all similarly situated
affected Indemnitees taken as a whole), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of the Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the
performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or any Letter of Credit or (iii) any actual
or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a
third party or by any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (i) is determined by a final and
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (or documented in any settlement agreement referred to below) to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its Related Party or, to the extent
such judgment finds (or any such settlement agreement acknowledges) that any such loss, claim, damage or liability has resulted from such Person’s or a Related Party of such Person’s material breach of the Loan Documents or (ii) arises out of any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding brought by such Indemnitee against another Indemnitee (other than any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding that is brought by or against the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Arranger, acting in its
capacity as the Administrative Agent, as an Issuing Bank or as an Arranger) that does not involve any act or omission of any Borrower or any of its subsidiaries. Each Indemnitee shall be obligated to refund or return any and all amounts paid by the
Borrowers pursuant to this Section 10.03(b) to such Indemnitee for any fees, expenses or damages to the extent such Indemnitee is not entitled to payment thereof in accordance with the terms hereof. All amounts due under this paragraph (b) shall be payable
by the Borrowers within 30 days (x) after receipt by the Parent of a written demand therefor, in the case of any indemnification obligations and (y) in the case of reimbursement of costs and expenses, after receipt by the Parent of an invoice, setting forth such
costs and expenses in reasonable detail, together with backup documentation supporting the relevant reimbursement request. This Section 10.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages or liabilities
arising from any non-Tax claim.
(c)
The Borrowers shall not be liable for any settlement or compromise of, or the consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any proceeding effected without its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), but if any proceeding is so settled, compromised or consented to with the Parent’s written consent, or if there is a final judgment entered against any Indemnitee in any such proceeding, the Borrowers agree to indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnitee to the extent and in the manner set forth above. The Borrowers shall not, without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement
of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnity has been sought hereunder by such Indemnitee unless (i) such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of
such proceeding and (ii) such settlement does not include any statement as to any admission of fault or culpability.
Section 10.04. Waiver of Claim. To the extent permitted by applicable law, no party to this Agreement shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto, any other Loan Party and/or any Related Party of any
thereof, on any theory of liability, for
208
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or any Letter of
Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof, except, in the case of any claim by any Indemnitee against any Borrower, to the extent such damages would otherwise be subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms of Section 10.03.
Section 10.05. Successors and Assigns.
(a)
The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided that (i) except as provided under Section 6.07 and/or pursuant to any
Permitted Reorganization, the Borrowers may not assign or otherwise transfer any of their rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by a Borrower without such consent shall be
null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with the terms of this Section (any attempted assignment or transfer not complying with the terms of this Section shall be null and
void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and permitted assigns, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to
the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. Any Successor Parent or
Successor Borrower permitted pursuant to a transaction referred to in clause (i) of the proviso above, shall thereafter be deemed to be and become the “Parent” or a “Borrower”, as applicable, for all purposes hereunder, and such initial Parent or initial
Borrower, as applicable, shall be released from its Loan Document Obligations in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
(b)
(i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of any Loan or
Additional Commitment added pursuant to Sections 2.22, 2.23 or 10.02(c) at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:
(A)
the Parent; provided that the Parent shall be deemed to have consented to any assignment of Term Loans if it has not responded to a written request for its consent from the Administrative Agent
within 10 Business Days after receiving such written request; provided, further, that no consent of the Parent shall be required (x) for any assignment of Term Loans or Term Commitments to another Lender, an Affiliate of
any Lender or an Approved Fund or (y) for any assignment during the continuance of a Specified Event of Default;
(B)
the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for any assignment to another Lender, any Affiliate of a Lender or any Approved Fund, or for any
assignment to the Parent and/or its Affiliates, which otherwise complies with the terms of this Section 10.05; and
209
(C)
(ii)

in the case of any Revolving Facility, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender.

Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

(A)
except in the case of any assignment to another Lender, any Affiliate of any Lender or any Approved Fund or any assignment of the entire remaining amount of the relevant assigning Lender’s Loans
or commitments of any Class, the principal amount of Loans or commitments of the assigning Lender subject to the relevant assignment (determined as of the date on which the Assignment Agreement with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent and determined on an aggregate basis in the event of concurrent assignments to Related Funds or by Related Funds) shall not be less than (x) $1,000,000, in the case of
Term Loans and Term Commitments and (y) $5,000,000 in the case of Revolving Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments unless the Parent and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent to a lesser amount, and in
each case any assigned amount may exceed such minimum amount in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;
(B)

any partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the relevant assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement;

(C)
the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment Agreement via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (or, if
previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually), and shall pay to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee may be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent and which fee shall not apply for any assignment to an Affiliated Lender);
(D)
the relevant Eligible Assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver on or prior to the effective date of such assignment, to the Administrative Agent and the Parent (irrespective of whether an Event of
Default exists) (1) an Administrative Questionnaire and (2) any form required under Section 2.17; and
(E)
the assigning Lender shall, concurrently with its delivery of the same to the Administrative Agent, provide the Parent with a copy of its request for such assignment, which shall include the name of
the prospective assignee (irrespective of whether an Event of Default exists).
210
(iii)
Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.05(g), subject to the acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in any Assignment
Agreement, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be (A) entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring on or prior to the
effective date of such assignment and (B) subject to its obligations thereunder and under Section 10.13). If any assignment by any Lender holding any Promissory Note is made after the issuance of such Promissory Note, the assigning
Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender such Promissory Note to the Administrative Agent for cancellation, and, following such cancellation, if requested by either the
assignee or the assigning Lender, the applicable Borrower shall issue and deliver a new Promissory Note to such assignee and/or to such assigning Lender, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the new commitments and/or outstanding
Loans of the assignee and/or the assigning Lender.
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, and the commitment of, and principal amount of and interest on the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the “Register”). Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect the Borrowers’ obligations in respect of such Loans and LC Disbursements. The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers, each Issuing Bank and each Lender (but only as to its own holdings), at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v)
Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee, the Eligible Assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire and any tax certification
required by paragraph (b)(ii)(D)(2) of this Section, the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section, if applicable, and any written consent to the relevant assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly accept such Assignment Agreement and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the
Register as provided in this paragraph.
211
(vi) By executing and delivering an Assignment Agreement, the assigning Lender and the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:
(A) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that the amount of its commitments, and the outstanding balances of its Loans, in each
case without giving effect to any assignment thereof which has not become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment Agreement, (B) except as set forth in clause (A) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty
and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of
any of its obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (C) such assignee represents and warrants that it is an Eligible Assignee, legally authorized to enter into
such Assignment Agreement; (D) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement and each then-applicable Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement, together with the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to
Section 5.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment Agreement; (E) such assignee will independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent, the assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it deems appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement; (F) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent, by the terms hereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (G) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a
Lender.
(c)
(i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Parent, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or any other Lender, sell participations to any bank or other entity (other than to any Defaulting Lender or any
natural Person) (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which any Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the relevant Participant, agree to
any amendment, modification or waiver described in (x) clause (A) of the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that directly and adversely affects the Loans or commitments in which such
212
Participant has an interest and (y) clauses (B)(1), (2) or (3) of the first proviso to Section 10.02(b). Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to
the limitations and requirements of such Sections and Section 2.19) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered solely to the participating Lender, and if additional amounts are required to be paid to the Participant pursuant to Section 2.17(a) or Section 2.17(c), to the Parent). To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law,
each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant shall be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.
(ii)
No Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the participating Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to a greater payment results from any Change in Law occurring after the sale of the participation.
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the applicable Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and their respective successors and
assigns, and the principal amounts and stated interest of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of
the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to any Participant’s interest in any Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or any other obligation under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that
such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest
error, and each Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative
Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(d)
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (other than to any Defaulting Lender or any natural person) to secure obligations of such Lender, including
without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section 10.05 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release any Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPC”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the
Administrative Agent and the Parent, the option to provide to the applicable Borrowers all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the applicable Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement; provided that
(i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to
the terms hereof and (iii) in no event may any Lender grant any option to provide to a Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would have otherwise been obligated to make to a Borrower pursuant to this Agreement to any Defaulting
Lender. The making of any Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such
213
Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) an SPC shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, Section 2.16 and Section 2.17 (subject to the limitations and requirements of such Sections and Section 2.19; it being understood that any
documentation required to be provided by SPC under Section 2.17(e) shall be provided solely to the Granting Lender and if additional amounts are required to be paid to the Participant pursuant to Section 2.17(a) or Section 2.17(c), to the Parent) to the same
extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; (ii) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change
the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17) and no SPC shall be entitled to any greater amount under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document that the Granting Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to any greater amount results from any Change in Law occurring after the grant is made, (iii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar
payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender) and (iv) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes including approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of the Loan
Documents, remain the Lender of record hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the
Requirements of Law of the U.S. or any State thereof; provided that (i) such SPC’s Granting Lender is in compliance in all material respects with its obligations to the Borrowers hereunder and (ii) each Lender designating any SPC hereby agrees to
indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such SPC during such period of forbearance. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 10.05, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Parent or the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loan to the
Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.
(f)
Any assignment or participation by a Lender without the Parent’s consent, to the extent the Parent’s consent is required under this Section 10.05, to any other Person, shall be null and void, and the Parent and/or any Borrower shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to unwind any such assignment or participation and/or specifically enforce this Section 10.05(f) in addition to injunctive relief (without posting a bond or presenting evidence of irreparable harm) or any other remedies
available to the Parent and/or any Borrower at law or in equity; it being understood and agreed that the Parent and its subsidiaries will suffer irreparable harm if any Lender breaches any obligation under this Section 10.05 as it relates to any assignment,
participation or pledge of any Loan or Commitment to any Person to whom the Parent’s consent is required but not obtained. Nothing in this Section 10.05(f) shall be deemed to prejudice any right or remedy that the Parent or any Borrower may otherwise
have at law or equity.
(g)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Term
214

Loans to an Affiliated Lender on a non-pro rata basis (A) through Dutch Auctions, or similar transactions pursuant to procedures to be established by the applicable “auction agent” that are consistent with this Section 10.05(g), in each case open to all
Lenders holding the relevant Term Loans on a pro rata basis or (B) through open market purchases (which purchases may be effected at any price as agreed between such Lender and such Affiliated Lender in their respective sole discretion), in each case with
respect to clauses (A) and (B), without the consent of the Administrative Agent; provided that:
(i)
any Term Loans acquired by any Affiliated Lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, be retired and cancelled immediately upon the acquisition thereof; provided that upon any such
retirement and cancellation, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans shall be deemed reduced by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans so retired and cancelled, and each principal
repayment installment with respect to the Initial Term Loans and/or First Incremental Term Loans (as applicable) pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall be reduced on a pro rata basis by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of
Initial Term Loans and/or First Incremental Term Loans so cancelled;
(ii)

[reserved];

(iii)

the relevant Affiliated Lender and assigning Lender shall have executed an Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption;

(iv)

[reserved];

(v)
in connection with any assignment effected pursuant to a Dutch Auction and/or open market purchase conducted by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, (A) the relevant Person may not use the proceeds of
any Revolving Loans to fund such assignment and (B) no Event of Default exists at the time of acceptance of bids for the Dutch Auction or the confirmation of such open market purchase, as applicable;
(vi)

[reserved];

(vii)
no Affiliated Lender shall be required to represent or warrant that it is not in possession of material non-public information with respect to the Parent and/or any subsidiary thereof and/or their respective securities in
connection with any assignment permitted by this Section 10.05(g).
Section 10.06. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loan and issuance of any Letter of Credit regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended
hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Termination Date. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 10.03 and 10.13 (with respect to Section 10.13, only for a period of
215
one year following such Termination Date) and Article 9 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of
Credit or any Commitment, the occurrence of the Termination Date or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof but in each case, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.
Section 10.07. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken
together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Fee Letter and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to
the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Restatement
Agreement, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or by email as a “.pdf”
or “.tif” attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
Section 10.08. Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, any provision of any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in
any other jurisdiction.
Section 10.09. Right of Setoff. At any time when an Event of Default exists, upon the written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations (in any currency) at any time owing by the Administrative Agent,
such Issuing Bank or such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Parent or any other Loan Party against any of and all the Obligations held by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender, irrespective of whether or not the
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or Issuing Bank different than
the branch or office holding such deposit or obligation on such Indebtedness. Any applicable Lender or Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Parent and the Administrative Agent of such set-off or application; provided that any failure to give or any delay in
giving such notice shall not affect the validity of any such set-off or application under this Section. The rights of each Lender, each Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) which such Lender, such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent may have.

fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and such Loan Party, its respective stockholders or its respective affiliates, on the other. Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process
leading thereto, (x) no Lender, in its capacity as such, has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Loan Party,
219
its respective stockholders or its respective affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently
advising or will advise any Loan Party, its respective stockholders or its respective Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to any Loan Party except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender, in its capacity as
such, is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of such Loan Party, its respective management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that such Loan Party has consulted its own legal, tax

from any of its obligations hereunder.
(b)
The respective obligations of the Borrowers hereunder are several and not joint. References herein to “Obligations of the Borrowers” or similar words of import are used solely for administrative convenience and are not intended to
create liability that is joint and several.

220
(the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender or Issuing Bank holding such Loan or Letter of Credit in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan or Letter of Credit hereunder, together with all Applicable Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Applicable Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan or
Letter of Credit but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Applicable Charges payable to such Lender or Issuing Bank in respect of other Loans or Letters of Credit or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender or Issuing Bank.
Section 10.20. Judgment Currency.
(a)
If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Loan Party in any court in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into any other currency (such other currency being hereinafter in this Section 10.20
referred to as the “Judgment Currency”) an amount due under any Loan Document in any currency (the “Obligation Currency”) other than the Judgment Currency, the conversion shall be made at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business Day
immediately preceding the date of actual payment of the amount due, in the case of any proceeding in the courts of any jurisdiction that will give effect to such conversion being made on such date, or the date on which the judgment is given, in the case of
any proceeding in the courts of any other jurisdiction (the applicable date as of which such conversion is made pursuant to this Section 10.20 being hereinafter in this Section 10.20 referred to as the “Judgment Conversion Date”).
(b)
If, in the case of any proceeding in the court of any jurisdiction referred to in Section 10.20(a), there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Conversion Date and the date of actual receipt for value of the
amount due, then the applicable Loan Party or Loan Parties shall pay such additional amount (if any, but in any event not a lesser amount) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount actually received in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the rate
of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will provide the amount of the Obligation Currency which could have been purchased with the amount of the Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial order at the rate of exchange prevailing on
the Judgment Conversion Date. Any amount due from any Loan Party under this Section 10.20(b) shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other amounts due under or in respect of any of the Loan
Documents.
(c)
The term “rate of exchange” in this Section 10.20 means the rate of exchange at which Administrative Agent, on the relevant date at or about 12:00 noon (New York time), would be prepared to sell, in accordance with Administrative
Agent’s normal course foreign currency exchange practices, the Obligation Currency against the Judgment Currency.
Section 10.21. Conflicts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any other Loan Document, the terms of this
Agreement shall govern and control; provided that in the case of any conflict or inconsistency between the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
221
and any other Loan Document (other than this Agreement, except with respect to Lien priority), the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control.
Section 10.22. Release of Guarantors. Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.02(b) to the contrary, (a) any Subsidiary Guarantor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder (and its Loan Guarantee shall be automatically
released) (i) upon the consummation of any permitted transaction or series of related transactions or the occurrence of any other permitted event or circumstance if as a result thereof such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (including
by merger, amalgamation or dissolution) or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a single transaction or series of related transactions or other event or circumstance permitted hereunder; or (ii) upon the occurrence of the Termination Date and/or
(b) any Subsidiary Guarantor that qualifies as an “Excluded Subsidiary” shall be released from its obligations hereunder (and its Loan Guarantee shall be automatically released) by the Administrative Agent promptly following the request therefor by the
Parent. In connection with any such release, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to receipt of an officer’s certificate from the Parent certifying that such transaction and release are permitted hereunder, promptly execute and deliver to the relevant Loan
Party, at such Loan Party’s expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence termination or release. Any execution and delivery of any document pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 10.22 shall be without
recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
Section 10.23. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties,
each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and each

ARTICLE 11

PARALLEL DEBT
Section 11.01. Purpose; Governing Law. This Article 11 is included in this Agreement solely for the purpose of ensuring the validity and effect of certain security rights governed by the laws of the Netherlands, Poland, Japan, Slovenia,
Lithuania, France, Hungary, Germany, Belarus, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and Serbia granted or to be granted pursuant to the applicable Collateral Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not limit the rights and remedies
provided to the Administrative Agent by the other provisions hereof and the provisions of the other Loan Documents.
Section 11.02. Parallel Debt (The Netherlands, Poland, Japan, Slovenia, Lithuania).
(a)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the Collateral Documents and for the purpose of the security rights granted and to be granted under or
225

pursuant to the Collateral Documents governed by the laws of The Netherlands, the laws of Poland, the laws of Japan, the laws of Slovenia and the laws of Lithuania (the “Specified Collateral Documents”), the Borrowers and each Loan Party that is a party
to the Specified Collateral Documents undertake to pay to the Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity as creditor in its own right and not as agent, representative or trustee, as a separate independent obligation to the Administrative Agent, the amount
of its Parallel Debt. Moreover, the security rights contemplated by the applicable Specified Collateral Documents are granted in favor of the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity and not as agent, representative or trustee for the Secured Parties, as
security for its claims under the Parallel Debt and consequently the Administrative Agent is the sole security beneficiary of such security rights.
(b)

No person shall be obligated to pay any amount representing Parallel Debt unless and until a corresponding amount of the Underlying Debt shall have become due and payable.

(c)
To the extent any amount is paid to and received by the Administrative Agent in payment of the Parallel Debt, the total amount due and payable in respect of the Underlying Debt shall be decreased as if such amount were received by
the Secured Parties or any of them in payment of the corresponding Underlying Debt.
Section 11.03. Parallel Debt (France). For the purpose of any Collateral Document or Lien governed by the laws of France (the “French Collateral Documents”) and all security interests created thereunder:
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to pay to the Administrative Agent, as creditor in its own right and not as
representative of the other Secured Parties, sums equal to and in the currency of each amount payable by such Borrower and each such Loan Party to each of the Secured Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as and when that amount
falls due for payment under this Agreement or the relevant Loan Document (the “French Parallel Debt”).
(b)
Each Borrower and each other Loan Party and the Administrative Agent acknowledge that the obligations of the Borrowers and each other Loan Party under clause (a) above are several and are separate and independent from, and
shall not in any way limit or affect, the corresponding obligations of the Borrowers or such Loan Party, as applicable, to any Secured Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (as used in this Section 11.03, its “Corresponding Debt”) nor
shall the amounts for which each Borrower and each other Loan Party is liable under the French Parallel Debt be limited or affected in any way by its Corresponding Debt; provided that:
(i)

the French Parallel Debt of each Borrower and each other Loan Party shall be decreased to the extent that its Corresponding Debt has been irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged;

(ii)

the Corresponding Debt of each Borrower and each other Loan Party shall be decreased to the extent that its French Parallel Debt has been irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged; and
226

(iii)

the amount of the French Parallel Debt of each Borrower or any other Loan Party shall at all times be equal to the amount of its Corresponding Debt.

(c)
For the purpose of this Section 11.03, the Administrative Agent acts in its own name and not as a trustee, and its claims in respect of the French Parallel Debt shall not be held on trust. The Collateral granted under the French
Collateral Documents to the Administrative Agent is granted to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as creditor of the French Parallel Debt and shall not be held on trust.
(d)
All moneys received or recovered by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 11.03, and all amounts received or recovered by the Administrative Agent from or by the enforcement of any Collateral granted under the French
Collateral Documents, shall be applied in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
(e)

Lender, Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender.
Section 11.04. Parallel Debt (Hungary). Each Secured Party hereby authorizes and appoints the Administrative Agent to accept, register in its name (but for the benefit of each Secured Party), manage and enforce, as its collateral
representative (in Hungarian: “bizományos” or, after the entry into force within the meaning of Act V of 2013 on the Hungarian civil code (the “Hungarian Civil Code”), “zálogjogosulti bizományos”) any charge based Collateral granted to the
Administrative Agent in relation to this Agreement and the Collateral Documents and to act and execute on its behalf in such capacity, subject to the terms of the Loan Guarantee entered into by any Subsidiary Guarantor incorporated under the laws of
Hungary, amendments or releases of, accessions and alterations to, and to carry out similar dealings with regard to this Agreement or any Collateral Document governed by the laws of Hungary or entered into by a Subsidiary Guarantor incorporated under the
laws of Hungary. For the purposes of the Hungarian Civil Code, (i) this provision constitutes the agreement of all Secured Parties regarding the authorization and appointment of the Administrative Agent as “zálogjogosulti bizományos” for enforcing,
registering in its name, managing and administering any charge based Collateral entered into by a Subsidiary Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Hungary (for the purposes of, and as envisaged by, Article 5:96.§ (1) of the Hungarian Civil Code), (ii) in
case there are discrepancies (including inter alia matters pertaining to sharing, settlement, flow of funds and rights of the Administrative Agent) not expressly regulated by Hungarian law between the regulations of Article 5:96.§ (1) of the Hungarian Civil
Code and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail to the extent permitted by law, (iii) the liability of each Secured Party for the actions of the Administrative Agent acting as its collateral representative (“zálogjogosulti bizományos”) shall be
considered as limited for the purposes of 5:96. § (6) of the Hungarian Civil Code, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement governing such liability and (iv) as permitted by Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of 17 June 2008, this Section 11.04 shall be
governed by Hungarian law. The Administrative Agent hereby accepts, and the Borrowers and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby acknowledge, such appointment as of the date hereof.

Security”):

Each Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to pay to the Administrative Agent as creditor in its own right and not as a representative of the other Secured Parties amounts equal to the
respective Underlying Debt.
(b)
Each Borrower and each other Loan Party and the Administrative Agent acknowledge that the obligations of each Borrower and each other Loan Party under clause (a) above are several and are separate and independent from, and
shall not in any way limit or affect, the Underlying Debt (as used in this Section 11.05, its “Corresponding Debt”) nor shall the amounts for which each Borrower and each other Loan Party are liable under clause (a) above (its “German Parallel Debt”) be
limited or affected in any way by its Corresponding Debt; provided that:
(i)
The Administrative Agent shall not demand payment with regard to the German Parallel Debt of a Borrower or another Loan Party to the extent that such Borrower or such Loan Party’s Corresponding Debt has been
irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged; and

a Secured Party shall not demand payment with regard to the Corresponding Debt of a Borrower or another Loan Party to the extent that such Borrower or such Loan Party’s Parallel Debt has been irrevocably paid or
(in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged.

the Collateral Documents to the Administrative Agent to secure the German Parallel Debt are granted to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as creditor of the German Parallel Debt and shall not be held on trust.

Borrower and each other Loan Party acknowledge that:
(i)
nothing in this Section 11.05 shall impose any obligation on the Administrative Agent to advance any sum to any Borrower or any other Loan Party or otherwise under this Agreement or any Collateral Document,
except in its capacity, if any, as a Lender, Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender; and
(ii)

for the purpose of any vote taken under this Agreement or any Collateral Document, the Administrative Agent shall not be regarded as having any participation or
228

commitment other than those which it has in its capacity, if any, as a Lender, Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender.
Section 11.06. Parallel Debt (Belarus).
(a)

For purposes of each Collateral Document governed by the laws of (or to the extent affecting assets situated in) Belarus, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any Collateral Document:

(i)
Each Borrower and each other Loan Party must pay the Administrative Agent, as an independent and separate creditor, an amount equal to each Secured Party Claim on its due date (each a “Belarus Parallel Debt
Claim”). For the purposes of Belarusian law, the Administrative Agent is the joint and several creditor with each other Secured Party in respect of each Secured Party Claim, having an independent right to demand and enforce payment of
each Belarus Parallel Debt Claim on the terms set out in clauses (v) to (xii) below.
(ii)

Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement or any Collateral Document, the Administrative Agent holds:
(A) the benefit of any Belarus Parallel Debt Claims; and

(B) any proceeds of the enforcement of any Collateral Documents governed by Belarusian law, for the benefit, and as the property, of, and on trust for, the Secured Parties and so that they are not available to
the personal creditors of the Administrative Agent.
(iii)

The Administrative Agent will separately identify in its records the property rights referred to in clause (i) above.

(iv)

The property rights under clause (i) above are located in the jurisdiction where the Administrative Agent maintains its accounts in respect of those property rights.

(v)
The Administrative Agent may enforce performance of any Belarus Parallel Debt Claim in its own name as an independent and separate right. This includes filing any suit, execution, enforcement of Collateral
Documents governed by Belarusian law in accordance with their respective terms, recovery of guarantees and applications for and voting in respect of any kind of insolvency proceeding.
(vi) Each Secured Party must, at the request of the Administrative Agent, perform any act required in connection with the enforcement of any Belarus Parallel Debt Claim. This includes issuing a power of attorney to the
Administrative Agent and joining in any proceedings as co-claimant with the Administrative Agent.
(vii)
Unless the Administrative Agent fails to enforce a Belarus Parallel Debt Claim within a reasonable time after its due date, a Secured Party may not take any action to enforce the corresponding Secured Party Claim
unless it is requested to do so by the Administrative Agent.
229
(viii)
Each Borrower and each Loan Party irrevocably and unconditionally waive any rights they may have to require a Secured Party to join in any proceedings as co-claimant with the Administrative Agent in respect of
any Belarus Parallel Debt Claim.
(ix) Discharge by a Borrower or a Loan Party of a Secured Party Claim will discharge the corresponding Belarus Parallel Debt Claim in the same amount and discharge by such Borrower or Loan Party of a Belarus
Parallel Debt Claim will discharge the corresponding Secured Party Claim in the same amount.
(x)

The aggregate amount of the Belarus Parallel Debt Claims will never exceed the aggregate amount of Secured Party Claims.

(xi) A defect affecting a Belarus Parallel Debt Claim against a Borrower or another Loan Party will not affect any Secured Party Claim and a defect affecting a Secured Party Claim against a Borrower or another Loan
Party will not affect any Belarus Parallel Debt Claim.
(xii)
If the Administrative Agent returns to a Borrower or any other Loan Party, whether in any kind of insolvency proceedings or otherwise, any recovery in respect of which it has made a payment to a Secured Party,
that Secured Party must repay an amount equal to that recovery to the Administrative Agent.
(b)

Each Secured Party:
(i)

confirms its approval of each Collateral Document governed by Belarusian law and authorizes entry by the Administrative Agent into Collateral Documents governed by Belarusian law in the future; and

(ii)

authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into and enforce the Collateral Documents governed by Belarusian law in its own name as the joint and several creditor with each Secured Party.

Section 11.07. Parallel Debt (Belgium).
(a)
For the purpose of this Section 11.07, “Corresponding Debt” means, with respect to each Loan Party incorporated under the laws of Belgium (each, a “Belgian Loan Party”), any Loan Party’s obligations and liabilities (whether
present or future, actual or contingent, and whether incurred jointly or severally, and whether as principal, guarantor or in some other capacity) (or any of their successors, transferees or assigns) to the Administrative Agent or one or more Secured Parties (or
any of their successors, transferees or assigns) (i) under or in connection with this Agreement or the Loan Documents, the Hedge Agreements or the Banking Services Obligations (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding the Parallel Debt Undertaking (as
defined below)), as the same may be amended, supplemented, extended or restated from time to time (including by way of novation), however fundamental any amendment, supplement, extension or restatement may be, including (without affecting the
generality of the foregoing) a change of purpose of any facility or the addition or increase of any facility, or (ii) in connection with any other Indebtedness as the Administrative Agent (acting on instructions of all Secured Parties) and the Parent may agree
from time to time.
230
(b)
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, on behalf of itself and its applicable Affiliates and in their respective capacities as such and as Secured Parties in respect of any Secured Hedging Obligations or Banking Services
Obligations, as applicable, hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (or any successor appointed pursuant hereto) as its agent (vertegenwoordiger/représentant) within the meaning of Article 3 of Title XVII of Book III of the Belgian Civil Code,
as amended by the law of 11 July 2013 amending the Belgian Civil Code in respect of security on movable assets and abolishing various relevant provisions and Article 5 of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act of 15 December 2004 and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to execute each Collateral Document expressed to be executed by the Administrative Agent on its behalf.
(c)
Each Belgian Loan Party irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay to the Administrative Agent amounts equal to the Corresponding Debt as they may exist from time to time (each, a “Belgian Parallel Debt”). Each Belgian
Parallel Debt will become due and payable at the same time as the Corresponding Debt becomes due and payable.
(d)
The rights of the Administrative Agent under this Section 11.07 are several and independent from any right that a Secured Party may have under this Agreement or the Collateral Documents. The Administrative Agent may therefore
enforce performance of the Belgian Parallel Debt in its own name as an independent and separate right. This includes any suit, execution, enforcement of security, recovery of guarantees and applications for and voting in respect of any kind of insolvency
proceeding.
(e)

An amount paid by a Belgian Loan Party to the Administrative Agent in respect of the Belgian Parallel Debt will discharge the liability of such Belgian Loan Party under the Corresponding Debt in an equal amount.

(f)

The aggregate amount outstanding under the Belgian Parallel Debt will never exceed the aggregate amount of the Corresponding Debt.

(g)

The Administrative Agent acts under this Agreement and the Collateral Documents as a creditor of the Belgian Parallel Debt.

(h)

A defect affecting a Belgian Parallel Debt against a Loan Party will not affect any Corresponding Debt.

(i)

A defect affecting a Corresponding Debt against a Loan Party will not affect any Belgian Parallel Debt.

Section 11.08. Parallel Debt (Switzerland). For the purpose of any Collateral Document or Lien governed by the laws of Switzerland (the “Swiss Collateral Documents”) and all security interests created thereunder:
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay to the Administrative Agent, as creditor in its own right and not as
representative of the other Secured Parties, amounts equal to and in the currency of each Payable Amount as and when that Payable Amount falls due for payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the “Swiss Parallel Debt”). For the
purpose of this Section 11.08, “Payable Amount” means in relation to a Borrower or a Loan Party,
231
any amount payable by such Borrower or such Loan Party to each of the Secured Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, but excluding any amounts of parallel debt payable by such Borrower or such Loan Party pursuant to this Article
11.
(b)
Each Borrower, each other Loan Party and the Administrative Agent acknowledge that the obligations of each Borrower and each other Loan Party under clause (a) above are several and are separate and independent from, and shall
not in any way limit or affect, the corresponding obligations of such Borrower or such Loan Party, as applicable, to any Secured Party under this Agreement or any Loan Document (as used in this Section 11.08, its “Corresponding Debt”) nor shall the
amounts for which the Borrowers or any other Loan Party is liable under the Swiss Parallel Debt be limited or affected in any way by its Corresponding Debt; provided that:

(i)

the Swiss Parallel Debt of each Borrower and of each other Loan Party shall be decreased to the extent that its Corresponding Debt has been irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged;

(ii)

the Corresponding Debt of each Borrower and of each other Loan Party shall be decreased to the extent that its Swiss Parallel Debt has been irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged; and

(iii)

the amount of the Swiss Parallel Debt of each Borrower or, respectively, a Loan Party, shall at all times be equal to the amount of its Corresponding Debt.

(c)
All monies received or recovered by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 11.08, and all amounts received or recovered by the Administrative Agent from or by the enforcement of any Collateral granted under the Swiss
Collateral Documents, shall be applied in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
(d)
For the purpose of any vote taken under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall not be regarded as having any participation or commitment other than those which it has, if any, in its capacity as a
Lender, Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender.
Section 11.09. Parallel Debt (United Arab Emirates). For the purposes of each Collateral Document governed by the laws of the United Arab Emirates:
(a)

Each Loan Party must pay the Administrative Agent, as an independent and separate creditor, an amount equal to each of its Secured Party Claims on its due date (each, a “UAE Parallel Debt Claim”).

(b)

Unless expressly provided to the contrary in any Loan Document, the Administrative Agent holds:
(i)

any security created by a Collateral Document governed by the laws of the United Arab Emirates;

(ii)

the benefit of any UAE Parallel Debt Claims; and

(iii)

any proceeds of any security created by a Collateral Document governed by the laws of the United Arab Emirates,
232

for the benefit, and as the property, of the Secured Parties and so that they are not available to the personal creditors of the Administrative Agent.
(c)

The Administrative Agent will separately identify in its records the property rights referred to in paragraph (b) above.

(d)

The property rights under paragraph (b) above are located in the jurisdiction where the Administrative Agent maintains its accounts in respect of those property rights.

(e)
The Administrative Agent may enforce performance of any UAE Parallel Debt Claim in its own name as an independent and separate right. This includes any suit, execution, enforcement of security, recovery of guarantees and
applications for and voting in respect of any kind of insolvency proceeding.
(f)
Each Secured Party must, at the request of the Administrative Agent, perform any act required in connection with the enforcement of any UAE Parallel Debt Claim. This includes joining in any proceedings as co-claimant with the
Administrative Agent.
(g)
Unless the Administrative Agent fails to enforce a UAE Parallel Debt Claim within a reasonable time after its due date, a Secured Party may not take any action to enforce the corresponding Secured Party Claim unless it is requested
to do so by the Administrative Agent.
(h)

Each Loan Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to require a Secured Party to join in any proceedings as co-claimant with the Administrative Agent in respect of any UAE Parallel Debt Claim.

(i)

Discharge by a Loan Party of a Secured Party Claim will discharge the corresponding UAE Parallel Debt Claim in the same amount.

(j)

Discharge by a Loan Party of a UAE Parallel Debt Claim will discharge the corresponding Secured Party Claim in the same amount.

(k)

The aggregate amount of the UAE Parallel Debt Claims will never exceed the aggregate amount of Secured Party Claims.

(l)

A defect affecting a UAE Parallel Debt Claim against a Loan Party will not affect any Secured Party Claim. A defect affecting a Secured Party Claim against a Loan Party will not affect any UAE Parallel Debt Claim.

(m)
If the Administrative Agent returns to any Loan Party, whether in any kind of insolvency proceedings or otherwise, any recovery in respect of which it has made a payment to a Secured Party, that Secured Party must repay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Administrative Agent.
Section 11.10. Parallel Debt (Serbia). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any of the Loan Documents, for the purpose of taking and ensuring the continuing validity of any Collateral Document or Lien governed by the
laws of Serbia (or to the extent affecting assets situated in Serbia), the Borrowers and each other Loan Party agree that the Administrative Agent shall be the joint and several creditor of each and every obligation of each Borrower and each other Loan Party
with each other Secured Party under the Loan Documents and that, accordingly,
233
the Administrative Agent will have its own independent right to demand performance by the Borrowers and each other Loan Party of these obligations. However, any discharge of any such obligation to one of the Secured Parties shall, to that extent,
discharge the corresponding obligation owing to the Administrative Agent. Nothing in this Agreement or any Loan Document shall in any way limit the Administrative Agent’s right to act in the protection or preservation of rights under the Loan Documents.
Section 11.11. Additional Parallel Debt Provisions. In the case of any Loan Party that becomes a Loan Party after the date hereof and is organized in a jurisdiction where “parallel debt” provisions are customary or required, the Parent and
the Administrative Agent are hereby authorized to provide for parallel debt, in customary form (as determined by the Parent in its sole discretion) in the Counterpart Agreement with respect to such Loan Party. The Administrative Agent and the Parent,
without the consent of any other Lender, Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or other Secured Party, may also (i) incorporate into this Agreement additional “parallel debt” provisions as necessary to address property acquired in any jurisdiction after the date
hereof where no assets are pledged by a Loan Party organized therein on the date hereof or (ii) amend the “parallel debt” provisions set forth herein in order to (A) cure omissions or defects or make changes of a technical nature or (B) accommodate any
Change in Law.
